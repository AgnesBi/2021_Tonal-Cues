	abstract = {The present paper presents an anaphoric account of presupposition. It is argued that presuppositional expressions should not be seen as referring expressions, nor is presupposition to be explicated in terms of some non-standard logic. The notion of presupposition should not be relegated to a pragmatic theory either. Instead presuppositional expressions are claimed to be anaphoric expressions which have internal structure and semantic content. In fact they only differ from pronouns and other semantically less loaded anaphors in that they have more descriptive content. It is this fact which enables them to create an antecedent in case discourse does not provide one. If their capacity to accommodate is taken into account they can be treated by basically the same mechanism which handles the resolution of pronouns. The theory is elaborated in the framework of discourse representation theory. It is shown that pragmatic factors interfere in the resolution of presuppositional anaphors. The resulting account can neither be classified as wholly semantic nor wholly pragmatic. Section 1 presents a survey of standing problems in the theory of presupposition projection and discusses the major competing approaches. An argumentation for a purely anaphoric account of presupposition is given in section 2. Section 3 presents a coding of presuppositional expressions in an extension of discourse representation theory. The final section is devoted to a discussion of the constraints which govern the resolution of presuppositional anaphors.},

The book  Makes a major contribution to ongoing research in the area of focus sensitivity – a field exploring interactions between sound and meaning, specifically the dependency some words have on the effects of focus, such as "she only LIKES me" (i.e. nothing deeper) compared to "she only likes ME" (i.e. nobody else) Discusses the features of the QFC theory (Quasi association, Free association, and Conventional association), a new account of focus implying a tripartite typology of focus-sensitive expressions Presents novel cross-linguistic data on focus and focus sensitivity that will be relevant across a range of linguistic sub-fields: semantics and pragmatics, syntax, and intonational phonology Concludes with a case study of exclusives (like “only”), arguing that the entire existing literature has missed crucial generalizations, and for the first time explaining the focus sensitivity of these expressions in terms of their meaning and discourse function},

Previously, self-explanation has been shown to improve the acquisition of problem-solving skills when studying worked-out examples. This study extends that finding, showing that self-explanation can also be facilitative when it is explicitly promoted, in the context of learning declarative knowledge from an expository text. Without any extensive training, 14 eighth-grade students were merely asked to self-explain after reading each line of a passage on the human circulatory system. Ten students in the control group read the same text twice, but were not prompted to self-explain. All of the students were tested for their circulatory system knowledge before and after reading the text. The prompted group had a greater gain from the pretest to the posttest. Moreover, prompted students who generated a large number of self-explanations (the high explainers) learned with greater understanding than low explainers. Understanding was assessed by answering very complex questions and inducing the function of a component when it was only implicitly stated. Understanding was further captured by a mental model analysis of the self-explanation protocols. High explainers all achieved the correct mental model of the circulatory system, whereas many of the unprompted students as well as the low explainers did not. Three processing characteristics of self-explaining are considered as reasons for the gains in deeper understanding.},

We propose that engaging in explanation can recruit comparison processes, and that this in turn contributes to the effectiveness of explanation in supporting category learning. Three experiments evaluated the interplay between explanation and various comparison strategies in learning artificial categories. In Experiment 1, as expected, prompting participants to explain items’ category membership led to (a) higher ratings of self-reported comparison processing and (b) increased likelihood of discovering a rule underlying category membership. Indeed, prompts to explain led to more self-reported comparison than did direct prompts to compare pairs of items. Experiment 2 showed that prompts to compare all members of a particular category (“group comparison”) were more effective in supporting rule learning than were pairwise comparison prompts. Experiment 3 found that group comparison (as assessed by self-report) partially mediated the relationship between explanation and category learning. These results suggest that one way in which explanation benefits category learning is by inviting comparisons in the service of identifying broad patterns.},

This paper proposes and tests a subsumptive constraints account of this effect. Motivated by philosophical theories of explanation, this account predicts that explaining guides learners to interpret what they are learning in terms of unifying patterns or regularities, which promotes the discovery of broad generalizations. Three experiments provide evidence for the subsumptive constraints account: prompting participants to explain while learning artificial categories promotes the induction of a broad generalization underlying category membership, relative to describing items (Exp. 1), thinking aloud (Exp. 2), or free study (Exp. 3). Although explaining facilitates discovery, Experiment 1 finds that description is more beneficial for learning item details. Experiment 2 additionally suggests that explaining anomalous observations may play a special role in belief revision.

In addition, the paper argues that highlighting-sensitivity should be incorporated in the account of another discourse particle, German überhaupt, and discusses how the proposed account of discourse particle denn may be extended to also cover the use of denn as a causal conjunction.},

	abstract = {In pedagogical contexts and in everyday life, we often come to believe something because it would best explain the data. What is it about the explanatory endeavor that makes it essential to everyday learning and to scientific progress? There are at least two plausible answers. On one view, there is something special about having true explanations. This view is highly intuitive: it’s clear why true explanations might improve one’s epistemic position. However, there is another possibility—it could be that the process of seeking, generating, or evaluating explanations itself puts one in a better epistemic position, even when the outcome of the process is not a true explanation. In other words, it could be that accurate explanations are beneficial, or it could be that high-quality explaining is beneficial, where there is something about the activity of looking for an explanation that improves our epistemic standing. The main goal of this paper is to tease apart these two possibilities, both theoretically and empirically, which we align with “Inference to the Best Explanation” (IBE) and “Explaining for the Best Inference” (EBI), respectively. We also provide some initial support for EBI and identify promising directions for future research.},

The inherent inconsistency of natural language induced by irreducible imprecision is investigated, and treated in terms of a dynamic extension of the proposed logic.  The book is an extended edition of a German monograph and is addressed to advanced students and researchers in theoretical and computational linguistics, logic, philosophy of language, and NL- oriented AI.

	abstract = {During the 2001 Linguistic Summer Institute at University of California, Santa Barbara, a group of linguists gathered at a workshop to discuss the expression and role of topicalization and focus from a variety of perspectives: phonetic, phonological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic. The workshop was designed to lay the groundwork for collaborative efforts between linguists devoted to the study of meaning and linguists engaged in the quantitative study of intonation. This volume contains papers emerging from the Santa Barbara Workshop on Topic and Focus. A wide variety of methodologies and research interests related to topic and focus are represented in the papers. Some works present results of phonetic studies, either acoustic or perceptual, on the expression of topic and/or focus; others examine semantic or pragmatic features of topic and/or focus, while others are concerned with the interface between intonation and meaning. Data from several different languages are represented in the papers, including several languages with relatively little documentation particularly in the venue of topic and focus, e. g. Basque, Chickasaw, Indonesian, Polish, Taiwanese. The broad sample of languages coupled with the wide variety of research topics addressed by the papers promise to enrich our typological understanding of topic and focus phenomena and provide an impetus for further research. The following paragraphs offer brief summaries of the papers contained in this volume: Gorka Elordieta’s paper describes prosodic conditions governing focus in a dialect of Basque with pitch accents.},

	abstract = {This paper explores what children and adults know about three specific ways that meaning and context interact: the interpretation of expressions whose extensions vary in different contexts (semantic context dependence); conditions on the felicitous use of expressions in a discourse context (presupposition accommodation) and informative uses of expressions in contexts in which they strictly speaking do not apply (imprecision). The empirical focus is the use of unmodified (positive form) gradable adjectives (GAs) in definite descriptions to distinguish between two objects that differ in the degree to which they possess the property named by the adjective. We show that by 3 years of age, children are sensitive to all three varieties of context–meaning interaction and that their knowledge of this relation with the definite description is appropriately guided by the semantic representations of the GA appearing in it. These findings suggest that children's semantic representations of the GAs we investigated and the definite determiner the are adult-like and that they are aware of the consequences of these representations when relating meaning and context. Bolstered by adult participant responses, this work provides important experimental support for theoretical claims regarding the semantics of gradable predicates and the nature of different types of ‘interpretive variability’, specifically semantic context dependence v. pragmatic tolerance of imprecision.},

	abstract = {The paper presents both new data and a new analysis of the semantic and pragmatic properties of the class of absolute scalar adjectives (ex. dry, wet, straight, bent, flat, empty, full…) within an extension of a well-known logical framework for the analysis of gradable predicates: the delineation semantics framework (DelS) (see Klein, Linguist Philos 4:1–45, 1980; van Benthem, Pac Philos Q 63:193–203, 1982; van Rooij, J Semant 28:335–358, 2011b, among many others). It has been long observed that the context-sensitivity, vagueness and gradability features of absolute scalar predicates give rise to certain puzzles for their analysis within most, if not all, modern formal semantic frameworks. While there exist proposals for solving these puzzles within other major frameworks (such as the degree semantics framework), it has been argued that some of their aspects are particularly challenging for the analysis of absolute scalar predicates within the delineation approach. By combining insights into the relationship between context-sensitivity and scalarity from the DelS framework with insights into the relationship between tolerance/similarity relations and the Sorites paradox from Cobreros et al.’s (2012) Tolerant, Classical, Strict (TCS) framework, I propose a new logical system, called Delineation TCS (DelTCS), in which to set analyses of four classes of adjectival predicates. I argue that this new framework allows for an analysis of absolute scalar adjectives that answers these challenges for delineation-based frameworks, while still preserving the heart of the Klein-ian approach.},

	abstract = {This chapter provides a (biased) overview of analyses of vagueness within linguistics. First, the nature of vagueness is discussed,
and contrasted with notions such as ambiguity and context dependence. After that, some reasons are given that could perhaps
explain why vagueness is such a pervasive phenomenon in natural language. This is followed with a review of some more or less
standard linguistic analyses of gradable adjectives. The chapter is focussed on approaches that take comparison classes into
account. Because comparative constructions are ideally formed in terms of gradable adjectives, comparative ordering relations
are discussed as well. It is argued that one specific ordering relation is crucial for any analysis of vagueness that wants
to capture the notion of ‘tolerance’: semi-orders. A lot of attention is given to contextuallist’ approaches that want to
account for the Sorites paradox, because these approaches are most popular within linguistics. In the final main section,
the chapter discusses what some people have called ‘loose talk’. The main issue here is whether with loose use of language
we say something that is strictly speaking false, but true enough in the particular conversational setting, or true, because
the conversational setting loosens the requirements for a sentence to be true.},

We contend that all gradable adjectives are interpreted relative to a comparison class (van Rooij 2011), and that it is the nature of the comparison class that constitutes the main semantic difference between their subclasses: some adjectives select a class comprised of counterparts of the individual of which the adjective is predicated, while others – an extensional category of this individual. We propose, following Kennedy (2007), that the standard of membership is selected according to a principle of economy whereby an interpretation relative to a maximum or a minimum degree within a comparison class takes precedence over one relative to an arbitrary point. This proposal captures so-called "standard shift" effects, that is, the influence of context on the interpretation of gradable adjectives from all subclasses, whether in their positive form or when modified by degree adverbials. Additionally, this proposal captures cases of apparent lack of context sensitivity (e.g. intuitive inference patterns, unacceptability of for-phrases, etc.). Finally, we hypothesize that the type of comparison class is aligned with the well known distinction between stage-level and individual-level predicates.},

	title = {Even and {Standards} of {Comparison}},

	abstract = {In this talk we examine the extent to which one of the observed challenges to the popular comparative likelihood (CL) approach to even p (‘p is less likely than its alternatives’) can be overcome.

The challenge is the inability of CL to capture the sensitivity of even to standards of comparison (as in John is even taller than Bill, entailing that both are POS tall, cf. Greenberg 2015, 2018).

Greenberg takes this challenge as one of the reasons to abandon CL and replace it with a ‘gradability-based’ semantics for even, where the comparative unlikelihood effects of even are derived from the interaction between its hardwired sensitivity to standards and the default use of ‘distributional standards’.

However, in light of the popularity, simplicity and widely discussed usefulness of CL we examine here the opposite derivation: namely assuming a hardwired CL presupposition for even and deriving standard-sensitivity of even from it.

Concentrating on even + comparatives with two focus placements, we show that this new derivation is partially successful, especially when CL is minimally revised by taking both p and its alternatives to be ‘unlikely’.

While we conclude that CL is still unable to derive all effects of even (e.g. with ‘functional standards’), and thus does not seem to lie at the core of its scalar presupposition, our findings can help sketch when CL can be nonetheless safely used to capture the interpretational effects of even and when it cannot.},

Two central questions are addressed: what information does the comparison class provide, and how is this information integrated compositionally? It is shown that the standard of comparison invoked by the positive form can be analyzed as a range of values whose width is based on the degree of dispersion in the comparison class. Compositionally, the comparison class can be analyzed as an argument of a null positive morpheme (contra Kennedy [13]), in parallel to recent proposals for the superlative (e.g. Heim [9]). The implications of the analysis for the choice between degree- and delineation-based analyses of gradable adjectives are discussed.},

We report simulations exploring the effect of background statistical knowledge on adjective interpretation in this model. Motivated by these simulation results, we suggest that this approach can account for the correlation between scale structure and the relative/absolute distinction while also allowing for exceptions noted in previous work. Finally, we argue for a probabilistic explanation of why the sorites paradox is compelling with relative adjectives even though the second premise is false on a universal interpretation, and show that this account predicts Kennedy’s (2007) observation that the sorites paradox is more compelling with relative than with absolute adjectives.},

To that end I first examine both familiar challenges for the popular ‘comparative likelihood’ view of the ‘stronger than’ relation, as well as novel challenges, having to do with the context dependency of even (with entailed and non-entailed alternatives) and with its sensitivity to standards of comparison. To overcome these challenges and to account for the full range of data I develop a revised, ‘gradability-based’ scalar presupposition for even, which differs from the ‘comparative likelihood’ one in several respects: instead of directly comparing degrees to which propositions (namely p and q) are more or less likely, we compare extents to which non-focus entities x in p and q (in the accessible p worlds and the exhaustified q worlds) exceed the salient standard on a scale associated with a contextually supplied gradable property G. To capture cases where information about contrastive topics is crucial for fixing two distinct standards on G, I follow theories which view even as a general, two-place alternative-sensitive operator, allowing it to associate with both focus and contrastive topics. Beyond the ability to account for a large range of intricate felicity variations and inferences found with even, a more general contribution of the paper lies in showing the linguistic relevance of tools originally developed in the literature on gradable predicates to the semantics of scalar alternative–sensitive particles.},

We show that this is false and propose an alternative theory, according to which superlative modifiers (at least/most) are quite different from comparative ones (more/less/fewer than). Whereas the naive theory is basically right about comparative modifiers, it is wrong about superlative modifiers, which we claim have a modal meaning: an utterance of At least three girls snored conveys two things: first, that it is certain that there was a group of three snoring girls, and second, that more than four girls may have snored. We argue that this analysis explains various facts that are problematic for the naive view, which have to do with specificity, distributional differences between superlative and comparative modifiers, differential patterns of inference licensed by these expressions, and the way they interact with various operators, like modals and negation.*},

Besides their practical relevance, these results clarify the formal relationships between both types of operators.

Pursuing the view that evaluativity is contributed by an optional null operator (EVAL, Rett 2008), this dissertation achieves the following results. First, it integrates a compositional analysis of evaluativity within a non-lexical view of antonymy. Second, it argues that the observed restrictions on the distribution of these inferences follow from independently motivated conditions that regulate the presence of the EVAL operator at the interfaces. In particular, three interface conditions are identified and discussed in detail: ++ At Logical Form (LF), derivations are subject to a structural economy condition, Minimize APs!, which executes transderivational comparisons over semantically equivalent Adjectival Phrases (APs).},

Studies on modal language to date have largely focussed on a small and non-representative subset of expressions, namely modal auxiliaries such as must, might, and ought. Here, Daniel Lassiter argues that we should expand the conversation to include gradable modals such as more likely than, quite possible, and very good. He provides an introduction to qualitative and degree semantics for graded meaning, using the Representational Theory of Measurement to expose the complementarity between these apparently opposed perspectives on gradation. The volume explores and expands the typology of scales among English adjectives and uses the result to shed light on the meanings of a variety of epistemic and deontic modals. It also demonstrates that modality is deeply intertwined with probability and expected value, connecting modal semantics with the cognitive science of uncertainty and choice.},

	abstract = {Theories of presupposition in the tradition associated with Karttunen, Stalnaker and Heim relate presupposition satisfaction to the content of conversational participants’ epistemic states, usually modeled as sets of worlds. However, converging evidence from recent work on modality and from other areas of cognitive science suggests that epistemic states are better thought of as having the richer structure of probability distributions. I describe an account of semantic and pragmatic presupposition which combines core ideas from dynamic semantic treatments with a probabilistic model of information states and their dynamics in conversation, and argue that it predicts the core data of the proviso problem (Geurts 1996) without invoking ad hoc mechanisms as conditional strengthening accounts typically do. The frequently cited intuition that (ir)relevance is crucial follows without stipulation, and I present new cases which suggest that irrelevance is too weak to predict all cases of unconditional presuppositions, problematizing strengthening accounts which rely on it. The proposed theory is able to account for this new data and also for semi-conditional presuppositions, a sticking point for previous theories of presupposition projection. I argue that this perspective also gives us a reasonable line on several related issues, including the divergence between presupposed conditionals and conditional presuppositions, instances of the proviso problem in counterfactuals, and the contextual variation in the difficulty of accommodation.

that the distribution and interpretation of degree modifiers is sensitive to its twomajor classificatory
parameters: (1) whether a gradable predicate is associated with what we call an open or closed
scale, and (2) whether the standard of comparison for the applicability of the predicate is absolute
or relative to a context. We further showthat the classification of an important subclass of
adjectives within the typology is largely predictable. Specifically, the scale structure of a deverbal
gradable adjective correlates either with the algebraic part structure of the event denoted by its
source verb or with the part structure of the entities to which the adjective applies. These correlations
underscore the fact that gradability is characteristic not only of adjectives but also of verbs
and nouns, and that scalar properties are shared by categorially distinct but derivationally related
expressions.},

On the one hand, if-clauses generally have an optative reading; on the other hand, optative 'at least' is an instance of concessive 'at least', which conveys desirability and thus supports ('cues') an optative reading. I propose that, as a consequence, the licensing of optativity by 'at least' is a semantic conspiracy: I argue that there is a pragmatic preference for using optativity cues, which blocks optative readings in cue-less utterances.},

	abstract = {This dissertation began asking where do we see addition in natural language? This began by reframing comparatives, it extended to other types of addition, looking at list environments and opening up questions about the nature of the language that enables "adding to lists", which in turn effected a cross-categorical research project, building on work on degree semantics, event semantics, focus, and discourse structure.
Work on comparatives is foundational in degree semantics and comparatives continue to be the source of ongoing research in the field (Cresswell, 1976; VonStechow, 1984; Kennedy \& Levin, 2008; Schwarzschild, 2008). Here I work on an understudied ambiguity that can be analyzed as more creating an event summing reading instead of the typically studied reading. I contribute novel data showing a class of expressions participates in this ambiguity, supporting a compositional analysis. Event semantics typically analyzes adjectival constructions as stative constructions, in lieu of incorporating degrees (Davidson, 1967; Parsons, 1990). This research works in the interface between these two subfields, and provides an argument for studying their interactions, as well as a compositional account of one way we see degree constructions build to event constructions.
From there, I follow morphological link to discover a class of data that impressionistically adds propositions to lists, including data with the focus sensitive particle also. Following Rooth (1992), I provide an analysis of this list effect via the semantics of focus and focus sensitivity. This requires assuming that propositions as a whole can be focused, which in turn requires precise assumptions about how the discourse context is framed formally. I follow both the Table theory from Farkas and Bruce (2010) and the conversational scoreboard model of Roberts (2004), showing that pieces of both models can function as contextual restrictions on the focus semantic value for focus sensitive expressions. Further investigation showed that other focus sensitive expressions can have similar restrictions, so major contributions of this include not only this revised notion of how to view "context", but also the ability to use focus sensitivity to investigate the nature of the discourse and what objects it contains.
The final section of this dissertation focuses on data linking these two previous sections. The appearance of aspectual particles like still in comparatives has been noted in the literature (Ippolito 2007). This pretheoretically looks like an event related expression contributing to a degree construction, which is the opposite direction from the data analyzed earlier in this dissertation. However, following Ippolito's lead in analyzing still here as a focus sensitive particle, I implement the analysis of focus and contextual restrictions I laid out in the previous chapter. The result is that no evidence is found for treating this case as an event construction building to a degree construction, but also further evidence is given for my theory in which objects in the discourse are the contextual limitations on focus semantic values.
The major contributions of this dissertation thus fall into two main categories or topics. On the subject of degrees and events, novel data solidified a previously observed link. Then the analysis I proposed supports a compositional and directional analysis where degree constructions can be built into event constructions. This highlights the importance of research on the interface between topics and theories within the same subfield, like degree and event semantics. On the subject of focus and the discourse, again I contribute novel data showing a class of expressions, which supports an analysis involving focusing whole propositions. This analysis gives evidence that objects in the discourse are the "context" that restricts the focus alternatives. These restrictions are lexical, showing that research in this area, looking at other focus sensitive expressions, gives us a new tool to investigate the structure of the discourse with.},

However, mutual belief is not sufficient to guarantee clarity (It is clear that God exists). I propose instead that It is clear that p means instead (roughly) ‘the publicly available evidence justifies concluding that p’. Then what asserting clarity reveals is information concerning the prevailing epistemic standard that determines whether a body of evidence is sufficient to justify a claim.

The questions of which adjectival constructions are evaluative and why have formed the foundation for semantic theories of these constructions and of adjectives themselves (Klein 1980, von Stechow 1984), although it has been alleged that these theories are based on an incomplete picture of the phenomenon of evaluativity (Bierwisch 1989, Rett 2008a). We present the first experimental tests of the scope and nature of evaluativity across adjectival constructions and adjective types. These studies confirm that evaluativity is conditioned by adjective type (relative or absolute, Kennedy \& McNally 2005) and is not restricted to the positive construction. However, they also show several new and surprising aspects of evaluativity: that it is perhaps better characterized as a gradable property than a binary one; that the ways in which relative and absolute adjectives differ in their evaluativity vary across construction; and that, contrary to standard intuitions, subjects are willing to attribute evaluativity to the subject position of comparative constructions like Sue is taller than Bill. We show that this last particularly surprising result reveals a lot about how subjects interpret contextually sensitive constructions, and we discuss its consequences for experimental studies and semantic theories of adjectival evaluativity as well as context-sensitive phenomena more generally.},

Syntactic Theory's step-by-step introduction to a consistent grammar in these core areas is complemented by extensive problem sets drawing from a variety of languages. The book's theoretical perspective is presented in the context of current models of language processing, and the practical value of the constraint-based, lexicalist grammatical architecture proposed has already been demonstrated in computer language processing applications.

	abstract = {Although the grammatical status of resumptive pronouns varies from one language to the other, these elements occur in spontaneous speech cross-linguistically, giving rise to a long-held intuition that resumption has a processing function, facilitating production and/or comprehension. In this review, I examine the central threads of thought related to resumption and processing and consider the prominent theories and findings that have shaped the discussion on this issue. I review grammatical and grammaticalization-based approaches to resumption and present the evidence suggesting that resumptive pronouns are a production artifact as well as the evidence that speaks in favor of or against the idea that resumptive pronouns aid comprehension. While the theory that resumption aids the producer receives straightforward support, the findings backing the claim that resumption helps the comprehender are much more equivocal, suggesting that in some cases resumption is not helpful and may even be detrimental to comprehension.},

	isbn = {978-0-19-969797-7},
	shorttitle = {Logic in {Grammar}},
	abstract = {This book investigates the relation between language and logic. Gennaro Chierchia looks at the way syntactic and inferential processes interact in determining polarity sensitive and free choice phenomena. He analyses these as a form of grammaticized scalar implicature and seeks to identify the common core of the polarity system by examining many of its manifestations as well as the choices that determine its diversity. To do so he reassesses the relations between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics and in the process makes startling insights into the relation of syntax to logic. Rudolf Carnap's classic, The Logical Syntax of Language, defines syntax as a lexicon and a set of formation rules and logic as a set of inference rules. Modern generative linguistics maintains a similar modular approach: a combinatorial apparatus is said to generate structures over which semantic and pragmatic relations, such as presupposition and implicature, are defined. This book argues by contrast that many structures typically perceived as syntactically deviant owe their status to their logical properties, in other words to whether they are contradictory or analytically true in specific ways. This alters the Carnapian view. The characterization of grammatical structure requires a more direct role of logical inferences: the functional lexicon of grammar comes, Professor Chierchia shows, with a set of inference rules that crucially and directly determine grammaticality patterns. Logic in Grammar presents the results of the author's decade-long work on pragmatics and scalar implicatures and extends his long-term project on how humans reason and categorize the world. It is a book that will interest linguists, philosophers, and cognitive scientists alike.},

	abstract = {This is an open access title available under the terms of a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licence. It is free to read at Oxford Scholarship Online and offered as a free PDF download from OUP and selected open access locations. This book presents a new logical framework to capture the meaning of sentences in conversation. The traditional approach equates meaning with truth-conditions: to know the meaning of a sentence is to know under which circumstances it is true. The reason for this is that linguistic and philosophical investigations are usually carried out in a logical framework that was originally designed to characterize valid argumentation. However, argumentation is neither the sole, nor the primary function of language. One task that language more widely and ordinarily fulfils is to enable the exchange of information between conversational participants. In the framework outlined in this volume, inquisitive semantics, information exchange is seen as a process of raising and resolving issues. Inquisitive semantics provides a new formal notion of meaning, which makes it possible to model various concepts that are crucial for the analysis of linguistic information exchange in a more refined and more principled way than has been possible in previous frameworks. Importantly, it also allows an integrated treatment of statements and questions.  The first part of the book presents the framework in detail, while the second demonstrates its benefits in the semantic analysis of questions, coordination, modals, conditionals, and intonation. The book will be of interest to researchers and students from advanced undergraduate level upwards in the fields of semantics, pragmatics, philosophy of language, and logic.},

	abstract = {1In this paper I document the complex interactions between the Mandarin sentence-final only item eryǐ and the focus marker shi. Following work on Chinese Sentence-Final Particles (SFP), eryǐ syntactically is in the CPdomain and thus should scope above TP-level operators such as negation, and this is indeed normally the case. However, the introduction of the focus marker shi can force the sentence-final eryǐ to take scope below the TP-level negation, creating a problem for the theory of Mandarin SFP. I propose that shi unambiguously marks the semantic scope of Mandarin focus-sensitive operators which involve Association With Focus. I show how this analysis preserves the expected syntactic cartography while computing the correct semantic scope. A compositional syntax/semantics utilizing focus movement is also presented.},

An anaphoric relation is typically said to hold whenever the semantic value of a linguistic form is related to the value of some previous or anticipated mention. The chapter lays out some boundary conditions for the syntax/semantics interface that anaphora questions inevitably invoke. The chapter explores Chomsky's Binding Theory. The richness of anaphoric morphology and its consequences for the syntax of anaphora are also discussed. Any plausible theory of anaphora must distinguish relations of dependent identity, pronouns bound as variables, and obviation. Competition-based theories of anaphora take the complementarities in the distributions of pronouns and anaphors.},

	abstract = {In spontaneous speech, English speakers produce relative clauses whose structures violate wh-island constraints but where resumptive pronouns appear in place of the gap/trace normally found in a relative clause. It is difficult to explain these island-violation remedying resumptive pronouns in a model of sentence production where only grammatically-licensed trees are available to the speaker’s production system. This paper argues that the only explanation for these island-violating relative clauses in such a model of sentence production is that they are fully grammatical constructions, whose marginal status reflects non-syntactic factors. The paper is structured as follows. The next section outlines the problem that resumptives in island contexts present for a model of sentence production using TAG. Section 3 argues that the problem can be resolved given the existence of resumptive pronouns in English in non-island contexts. Section 4 discusses two potential diffiulties for the analysis. Section 5 outlines some possible implications of the analysis for the typology of relative clauses in general. Finally, Section 6 concludes with suggestions for further investigation.},

A second goal consists in tracing the development of the strategies that have been employed in the compositional analysis of comparatives and the derivation of their underlying LF-representations. Third, the chapter elaborates on two strands of analyses toward phrasal comparatives ? the reduction analysis and the direct analysis ? which disagree on the amount of abstract syntactic structure they assign to the constituent following than. Special attention is given to the formal tools for interpreting the LFs posited by these two competing theoretical choices, and to the diagnostics that have been developed to discriminate between them. The debate has important repercussions, among others, for the organization of the functional lexicon; the limits of crosslinguistic variation; the division of labor between the syntactic and the semantic component; and the nature of the operations implicated in translating surface syntactic trees into transparently interpretable LF-representations.},

	abstract = {One of the success stories in formal semantics is the analysis of NPs as generalized quantifiers, which can be traced back from Barwise \& Cooper (1981) via Montague to Frege. The great attraction of this analysis is that it allows for a compositional analysis of the meaning of noun phrases that is consistent with independently motivated assumptions about their syntax. For example, Barwise and Cooper analyze NPs like every boy, a boy, three boys and no boy as having the syntactic structure [Det N], and interpretations as second-order predicates, as follows: (1) a. [every boy]  = λPλQ[P ⊆ Q]([boy]),  = λQ[[boy]  ⊆ Q] b. [a boy]  = λPλQ[P ∩ Q ≠ ∅]([boy]),  = λQ[[boy]  ∩ Q ≠ ∅] c. [three boys]  = λPλQ[\#(P ∩ Q)  ≥ 3]([boy]),  = λQ[\#([boy]  ∩ Q)  ≥ 3] d. [no boy]  = λPλQ[P ∩ Q = ∅]([boy]),  = λQ[[boy]  ∩ Q = ∅] These meanings can be combined with the meanings of verbal predicates, like left, and we end up with representations like the following: (2) a. [every boy left]  = λQ[[boy]  ⊆ Q]([left]),  = [boy]  ⊆ [left] b. [a boy left]  = λQ[[boy]  ∩ Q ≠ ∅]([left]),  = [boy]  ∩ [left]  ≠ ∅ c.

	abstract = {In this article, we describe and attempt to solve a puzzle arising from the interpretation of modified numerals like less than five and between two and five. The puzzle is this: such modified numerals seem to mean different things depending on whether they combine with distributive or non-distributive predicates. When they combine with distributive predicates, they intuitively impose a kind of upper bound, whereas when they combine with non-distributive predicates, they do not (they sometimes even impose a lower bound). We propose and explore in detail four solutions to this puzzle, each involving some notion of maximality, but differing in the type of maximality involved (‘standard’ maximality versus ‘informativity-based’ maximality) and in the source of maximality (lexically encoded in the meaning of the numeral modifier versus non-lexical). While the full range of data we consider do not conclusively favor one theory over the other three, we do argue that overall the evidence (i) goes against the view that modified numerals lexically encode a ‘standard’ maximality operator, and (ii) suggests the need for a pragmatic blocking mechanism that filters out readings (logical forms) of sentences that are generated by the grammar but intuitively unavailable.},

	abstract = {Three experiments investigated the acquisition of English epistemic modal verbs (e.g., may, have to). Semantically, these verbs encode possibility or necessity with respect to available evidence. Pragmatically, the use of weak epistemic modals often gives rise to scalar conversational inferences (e.g., “The toy may be under the sofa” implies that it is not certain that the toy is under the sofa). Experiment 1 showed that children between the ages of 4 and 5 have mastered key aspects of epistemic modal semantics but have difficulties with contexts involving epistemic possibility. Experiment 2 showed that 4–5-year-olds prefer stronger/more informative over weaker modal statements in contrastive contexts if the stronger statements are warranted by the evidence. Experiment 3 further demonstrated that children of this age can draw pragmatic inferences from the use of weak epistemic modal verbs in contexts that do not involve overt pragmatic judgments. Taken together, these findings throw light on the acquisition of epistemic modality and have implications for the development of the semantics-pragmatics interface.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.cognition.2003.10.002},
	abstract = {This article brings together two independent lines of research on numerally quantified expressions, e.g. two girls. One stems from work in linguistic theory and asks what truth conditional contributions such expressions make to the utterances in which they are used--in other words, what do numerals mean? The other comes from the study of language development and asks when and how children learn the meaning of such expressions. My goal is to show that when integrated, these two perspectives can both constrain and enrich each other in ways hitherto not considered. Specifically, work in linguistic theory suggests that in addition to their 'exactly n' interpretation, numerally quantified NPs such as two hoops can also receive an 'at least n' and an 'at most n' interpretation, e.g. you need to put two hoops on the pole to win (i.e. at least two hoops) and you can miss two shots and still win (i.e. at most two shots). I demonstrate here through the results of three sets of experiments that by the age of 5 children have implicit knowledge of the fact that expressions like two N can be interpreted as 'at least two N' and 'at most two N' while they do not yet know the meaning of corresponding expressions such as at least/most two N which convey these senses explicitly. I show that these results have important implications for theories of the semantics of numerals and that they raise new questions for developmental accounts of the number vocabulary.},

	abstract = {This paper studies a distinction that was proposed in previous works between total and partial adjectives. In pairs of adjectives such as safe–dangerous, clean–dirty and healthy–sick, the first (“total”) adjective describes lack of danger, dirt, malady, etc., while the second (“partial”) adjective describes the existence of such properties. It is shown that the semantics of adjective phrases with modifiers such as almost, slightly, and completely is sensitive to whether the adjective is total or partial. The interpretation of such modified constructions is accounted for using a novel scale structure for total and partial adjectives. It is proposed that the standard value of a total adjective is always fixed as the lower bound of the corresponding partial adjective. By contrast, the standard value of partial adjectives can take any point on the partial scale. The effects of this theoretical distinction on the behavior of modified constructions are studied in detail, and their ramifications for the semantic theory of adjectives are discussed. Some other phenomena are surveyed that show evidence for total and partial adjectival constructions with various comparatives and exceptive phrases.},

Why? Does this variability indicate a corresponding variability in the underlying semantics of the terms used to express gradability and comparison, or is a universal semantics of comparison obscured by superficial morphosyntactic variation? If the former, what (if any) aspects of the semantics of comparison are universal and what aspects are subject to cross-linguistic variation? If the latter, what is the universal semantics of comparison, and what are the (non-semantic) factors that give rise to the observed typological variation? The goal of this talk is both to consider some initial (and partial) answers to these questions in the context of a close examination of comparatives in English and Japanese, and (perhaps more importantly), some important tests for distinguishing between explicit and implicit comparison, as well as a guide for how to construct others: look for constructions and contexts that exploit the fact that the positive form is vague while the comparative form is not.

@inproceedings{greenberg_even_2015,
	title = {Even, {Comparative} {Likelihood} and {Gradability}},
	abstract = {A popular view of the semantics of even takes it to presuppose that its prejacent, p, is
less likely than all its contextually relevant focus alternatives, q. In this paper I point out
three novel problems for this `comparative likelihood' view, having to do with (a) cases
where even p is felicitous though p cannot be considered less likely than q, (b) cases where
even p is infelicitous though p asymmetrically entails and is less likely than q, and (c)
cases where even interacts with gradable predicates, indicating that merely requiring p to
be higher on the scale than q is not enough to make even p felicitous. Instead, both p and
q must also yield degrees which are at least as high as the standard of comparison.

In response to these problems I develop a revised scalar presupposition for even which
resembles the semantics of comparative conditionals, and which requires that for a salient
x, retrieved from p, and a salient gradable property G, (i) x's degree on G is higher in
all accessible p worlds than in all accessible q-and-not-p worlds and that (ii) in the latter
worlds this degree is at least as high as the standard on G. I show how this presupposition
accounts for both traditional observations concerning even, as well as for the novel data and
propose that the common presence of `less likely' inferences with even can be indirectly
derived from the common use of `distributional' standards of comparison with gradable
properties. A general contribution of the proposal, then, is in attempting to apply tools
from research of gradability-based phenomena for a better understanding of scalarity-based
phenomena.},

	abstract = {This article discusses and analyzes an unusual construction in Icelandic, with a plural pronoun in the singular reading and a directly juxtaposed or annexed NP (or DP), where, for example, við Ólafur (literally “we.NOM Olaf.NOM”) means ‘Olaf and I’. We refer to this construction as Pro[NP]. Pro[NP] constructions have been reported for a handful of languages that lack a case system. Icelandic, in contrast, is a case language, and Pro[NP] in this language is case congruent: the pronoun and its NP/DP annex are always in the same case. No such language has to our knowledge ever been described in detail before; we provide the first in-depth investigation of case-congruent Pro[NP]. The article further compares the Icelandic construction to apparently similar constructions, including English we linguists and the Russian type of Pro[x-NP], as in my s Petej (literally “we.NOM with Peter.INSTR”), meaning ‘Peter and I’, showing that the Icelandic construction differs from these, despite having similar (but not identical) semantic properties. We propose that plural personal pronouns consist of two parts: a set of variables, \{X, Y\}, that determine the form of the pronoun, and an NP annex, which constrains the interpretation of the Y variable. Typically, the annex is phonetically silent (bare plural pronouns), but the Icelandic construction is unusual in that the annex is partly overt, thereby allowing a rare insight into the construction of plural personal pronouns.},

Rather, the focus has been on how the media and political elites can racialize ostensibly nonracial political issues by priming White Americans’ racial attitudes, most effectively through the use of “implicit” racial cues, such as images of racial minorities or racial “code words” (Mendelberg 1997; 2001; Gilliam and Iyengar 2000; Valentino, Hutchings and White 2002), and how such racialization of political issues can result in significant reductions in White Americans’ support for these policies (Gilens 1999; Bobo and Kluguel 1997).},

I test the effectiveness of multivocal and obvious religious appeals experimentally with two national samples: an ingroup that understands the religious connotations in a multivocal appeal and a religiously diverse outgroup that does not. Religious appeals are persuasive for the ingroup, but an obvious religious appeal can be politically costly by triggering negative reactions among outgroup members, while the religious meaning in a multivocal appeal eludes them. Obvious religious appeals are costly in the diverse audience because of different preferences over the appropriate role for religion in political speech.},

The main proposal is that despite their appearance, Japanese clausal comparatives involve a nominal structure whose nominal head is deleted by a syntactic deletion operation, and therefore are underlyingly phrasal comparatives. It is demonstrated that this analysis explains peculiar syntactic and semantic properties of Japanese (seemingly) clausal comparatives, some of which have been unidentified in the previous literature. The proposed account also allows us to dispense with the previously proposed semantic variation specific to degree constructions, and entertain a more conservative view of crosslinguistic variation where the differences between Japanese-type and English-type comparative constructions are solely attributed to their morphosyntactic properties.},

Methods: The approach is based on complexity of neuromotor coordination across speech subsystems involved in respiration, phonation and articulation, motivated by the distinct nature of COVID-19 involving lower (i.e., bronchial tubes, diaphragm, lower trachea) versus upper (i.e., laryngeal, pharyngeal, oral and nasal) respiratory tract inflammation [1], as well as by the growing evidence of the virus' neurological manifestations [2]—[5]. Preliminary results: An exploratory study with audio interviews of five subjects provides Cohen's d effect sizes between pre-COVID-19 (pre-exposure) from post-COVID-19 (after positive diagnosis but asymptomatic) using: coordination of respiration (as measured through acoustic waveform amplitude) and laryngeal motion (fundamental frequency and cepstral peak prominence), and coordination of laryngeal and articulatory (formant center frequencies) motion. Conclusions: While there is a strong subject-dependence, the group-level morphology of effect sizes indicates a reduced complexity of subsystem coordination. Validation is needed with larger more controlled datasets and to address confounding influences such as different recording conditions, unbalanced data quantities, and changes in underlying vocal status from pre-to-post time recordings.},

As opposed to languages such as Hebrew or Irish, where such resumptive pronominals are in free variation with gaps and are grammatically unmarked (Sells, 1987, Sharvit, 1999, McCloskey, 2002), English resumptives lie at the margins of grammar. Referred to as 'intrusive' resumptive pronouns, they are often regarded as a 'last resort' device to preserve the grammaticality of the dependency (Ross, 1967, Sells, 1984). In particular, intrusive resumptive pronouns have famously been claimed to amnesty syntactic island violations, such as in the wh-island violation below (Ross, 1967, Kroch, 1981, Erteschik-Shir, 1992, Haegeman, 1994): (2) This is the man whom i Emsworth told me when we will invite him i . The resumptive pronoun here purportedly 'saves' the island violation, and the result of this assumption has been a number of syntactic analyses explaining why islands are not violated in such circumstances. As Alexopoulou and Keller (2007) (hereafter, AK) point out, the con-clusion that resumptive pronouns save island violations was reached without precise measurements of acceptability, relying instead on researchers' intu-itions. AK thus experimentally investigated judgments for island-violating},

	abstract = {Language comprehension, as with all other cases of the extraction of meaningful structure from perceptual input, takes places under noisy conditions. If human language comprehension is a rational process in the sense of making use of all available information sources, then we might expect uncertainty at the level of word-level input to affect sentence-level comprehension. However, nearly all contemporary models of sentence comprehension assume clean input---that is, that the input to the sentence-level comprehension mechanism is a perfectly-formed, completely certain sequence of input tokens (words). This article presents a simple model of rational human sentence comprehension under noisy input, and uses the model to investigate some outstanding problems in the psycholinguistic literature for theories of rational human sentence comprehension. We argue that by explicitly accounting for input-level noise in sentence processing, our model provides solutions for these outstanding problems and broadens the scope of theories of human sentence comprehension as rational probabilistic inference.},

	abstract = {We present an experimental investigation of the role of resumptive pronouns. We investigate object extraction in WH-questions for a range of syntactic configurations (nonislands, weak islands, strong islands) and for multiple levels of embedding (single, double, and triple). In order to establish the crosslinguistic properties of resumption, parallel experiments were conducted in three languages, viz. English, Greek, and German. Three main experimental results are reported. First, resumption does not remedy island violations: resumptive pronominals are at most as acceptable as gaps, but not more acceptable. This result disconfirms claims in the literature that resumptives can ‘save’ island violations. Second, embedding reduces acceptability even in extraction out of nonislands and declaratives, structures standardly assumed to be fully grammatical. Third, nonislands and weak islands pattern together and contrast with strong islands in terms of the effect of resumption and embedding. Our experimental findings show a remarkable consistency across the three languages we investigate; crosslinguistic variation appears confined to quantitative differences in crosslinguistically identical principles. We argue that these experimental results can be explained by the interaction of grammatical principles with resource limitations of the human parser. In particular, extraction from nonislands and weak islands imposes increased demands on the computational resources of the parser. We extend Gibson’s (1998) syntactic prediction locality theory in order to formalize this intuition and account for the processing complexity of A-bar dependencies.},

Since Geurts 1996, however, the promise of this research program has been tarnished by the observation that it systematically leads to incorrect predictions in cases where a presupposition ends up filtered which should not have been. I show that the satisfaction account of presupposition projection is in good stead, after all, by revealing that Geurts's observations are valid only under certain basic assumptions about semantic composition. To illustrate, I present a satisfaction account of presupposition projection that builds on the work of Charlow (2014, 2019a,b) in the context of a semantics based on alternatives, where, indeed, the proviso problem crops up. I slightly sophisticate the compositional repertoire, leading to a setting in which the proviso problem disappears. I additionally demonstrate some extensions of the proposed system for binding and presupposition accommodation.},

This constraint explains a number of very surprising features of Pirah grammar and culture: the absence of numbers of any kind or a concept of counting and of any terms for quantification, the absence of color terms, the absence of embedding, the simplest pronoun inventory known, the absence of relative tenses, the simplest kinship system yet documented, the absence of creation myths and fiction, the absence of any individual or collective memory of more than two generations past, the absence of drawing or other art and one of the simplest material cultures documented, and the fact that the Pirah are monolingual after more than 200 years of regular contact with Brazilians and the TupiGuaranispeaking Kawahiv.},

This quantificational asymmetry (QA) in the delay of Principle B effect (DPBE) has been taken as support for a theory that restricts the scope of binding theory to bound variable anaphora (Reinhart 1983). However, the QA has been challenged, on the basis of discrepant findings and methodological concerns (Elbourne 2005). Here, we resolve the status of the QA with 3 studies and a review of over 30 previous studies. Using improved experimental materials, we show that children disallow local pronoun binding with both referential and quantificational antecedents when Principle B is at issue (Experiment 1), but not when Principle B is neutralized (Experiment 2). When methodological flaws are reintroduced, we replicate the QA (Experiment 3). Drawing on evidence from adult language processing, we suggest that the role of Principle B as a filter on representations during sentence understanding, in concert with pragmatic infelicities in the tasks used, accounts for the wide variability in the DPBE in the literature.},

These limitations are even more severe for web-based crowdsourcing studies, where eye tracking is infeasible and self-paced reading is vulnerable to inattentive participants.  Here we make a case for broader adoption of the Maze task, involving sequential forced choice between each successive word in a sentence and a contextually inappropriate distractor.  We  leverage natural language processing technology to automate the most researcher-laborious part of Maze -- generating distractor materials -- and show that the resulting A(uto)-Maze method has dramatically superior statistical power and localization for well-established syntactic ambiguity resolution phenomena.

The experiments crossed the plausibility of the temporarily ambiguous noun as a direct object with verb bias, eliminating a confound present in earlier research and allowing an examination of interactions between the 2 factors. Unbiased verbs were included as well to evaluate the role of plausibility in the absence of verb bias. The results generally replicated findings by J. C. Trueswell et al., (1993) finding that verb bias has rapid effects on ambiguity resolution, and showed in addition that verb bias and plausibility interact during comprehension.

	abstract = {A fundamental question in contemporary minimalist approaches to movement is why copies left by phrasal movement are not realized. Particularly puzzling from this perspective is the observation that pronouns, in a range of environments, appear to function as spell-outs of gaps (e.g. Zaenen et al. 1981; Koopman 1982, 1984; Sells 1984; Engdahl 1985; Pesetsky 1998; Boeckx 2003; Kandybowicz 2007; Holmberg and Nikanne 2008; Harizanov 2014; Sichel 2014), a phenomenon I refer to as pronoun copying. This paper first presents a novel pronoun copying pattern in the Nilotic language Dinka Bor, in which a 3rd person plural pronoun spells out intermediate copies at the verb phrase edge. I then show that Dinka pronoun copying displays two unusual number asymmetries that provide a unique insight into the link between pronoun copying and copy deletion: (i) the pronoun matches only in number, not person, and (ii) only plural DPs initiate copying. Importantly, this number sensitivity mirrors a general asymmetry in the expression of singular and plural. I argue that this parallel reveals that pronoun copying in Dinka reflects partial deletion in a DP copy, deleting everything but the structure that hosts number information. The availability of partial deletion in multiple copy spell-out is shown to follow from an approach to copy deletion based on economy, as developed by Landau (2006). In support of this, I demonstrate that Dinka’s asymmetries in fact have their counterparts across pronoun copying constructions and develop a unified account of pronoun copying crosslinguistically.},

We address this question by mathematically analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of learning in deep linear networks. We find exact solutions to this learning dynamics that yield a conceptual explanation for the prevalence of many disparate phenomena in semantic cognition, including the hierarchical differentiation of concepts through rapid developmental transitions, the ubiquity of semantic illusions between such transitions, the emergence of item typicality and category coherence as factors controlling the speed of semantic processing, changing patterns of inductive projection over development, and the conservation of semantic similarity in neural representations across species. Thus, surprisingly, our simple neural model qualitatively recapitulates many diverse regularities underlying semantic development, while providing analytic insight into how the statistical structure of an environment can interact with nonlinear deep-learning dynamics to give rise to these regularities.},

Contrary to classic discussions of the phenomenon such as by Karttunen, Kratzer, and Veltman, we argue that instead of having a weak semantics, must presupposes the presence of an indirect inference or deduction rather than of a direct observation. This is independent of the strength of the claim being made. Epistemic must is therefore quite similar to evidential markers of indirect evidence known from languages with rich evidential systems. We work towards a formalization of the evidential component, relying on a structured model of information states (analogous to some models used in the belief dynamics literature). We explain why in many contexts, one can perceive a lack of confidence on the part of the speaker who uses must.},

	abstract = {This book introduces formal grammar theories that play a role in current linguistic theorizing (Phrase Structure Grammar, Transformational Grammar/Government \& Binding, Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, Lexical Functional Grammar, Categorial Grammar, Head-​Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, Construction Grammar, Tree Adjoining Grammar). The key assumptions are explained and it is shown how the respective theory treats arguments and adjuncts, the active/passive alternation, local reorderings, verb placement, and fronting of constituents over long distances. The analyses are explained with German as the object language. The second part of the book compares these approaches with respect to their predictions regarding language acquisition and psycholinguistic plausibility. The nativism hypothesis, which assumes that humans posses genetically determined innate language-specific knowledge, is critically examined and alternative models of language acquisition are discussed. The second part then addresses controversial issues of current theory building such as the question of flat or binary branching structures being more appropriate, the question whether constructions should be treated on the phrasal or the lexical level, and the question whether abstract, non-visible entities should play a role in syntactic analyses. It is shown that the analyses suggested in the respective frameworks are often translatable into each other. The book closes with a chapter showing how properties common to all languages or to certain classes of languages can be captured. The book is a translation of the German book Grammatiktheorie, which was published by Stauffenburg in 2010.

	isbn = {978-0-262-63090-0},
	abstract = {This book presents a theory of grammatical relations among sentential constituents which is a development of Chomsky's Government-Binding Theory. The cross-linguistic predictive power of the theory is unusually strong and it is supported in the examination of a wide range of languages.Within the syntax of a language, grammatical relations determine such things as word order, case marking, verb agreement, and the possibilities of anaphora (co- and disjoint reference) among nominals. Other approaches to grammatical relations have considered them to name classes of constituents that share clusters of properties, including most prominently structural positions or case marking, Still others have claimed that grammatical relations are primitives in syntactic theory, but are related essentially to semantic roles. Rejecting these approaches, this monograph develops a theory which includes at its core a "projection principle": The syntax of a language is assumed to be a (direct) "Projection" of the compositional sematics, and the mechanisms of projection are explicitly spelled out.Chapters cover the two asymmetries and two lexical features on which the theory is built; semantic and syntactic data from a wide variety of languages that support the universal applicability and explanatory power of these asymmetries and features; features of passive, antipassive, dative-shift, anticausative, causative, and applied verb constructions in the worlds' languages explained by the theory; confirmations of the theory's predictions in languages for which alternative approaches to grammatical relations fail to provide successful analyses; and, comparison of the book's conception of grammatical relations to those in the GB framework, Montague Grammar, Relational Grammar, and Lexical-Functional Grammar.Alec Marantz is affiliated with the Society of Fellows, Harvard University.

The framework takes into account the major works such as Chomsky's Knowledge of Language and Barriers written since the publication of Radford's widely acclaimed Transformational Syntax in 1981. Not only does the present book use a more recent theoretical framework, but at the descriptive level it covers a wider range of constructions and rules than its predecessor. Andrew Radford is well known for his effective pedagogical approach, and in this book even more care has been devoted to providing a sympathetic and non-technical introduction to the field. At the end of each chapter are exercises which reinforce the text, enable students to apply the various concepts, etc. discussed, or encourage them to look more critically at some of the assumptions and analyses presented. The book also has a detailed bibliographical background section and an extensive bibliography which will be a useful source of reference to the primary literature.

	abstract = {This paper explores the role that the scalar properties and presuppositions of even play in creating polarity sensitive even meanings crosslinguistically (henceforth EVEN). I discuss the behavior of three lexically distinct Greek counterparts of even in positive, negative, and subjunctive sentences, and polar questions. These items are shown to be polarity sensitive, and a three-way distinction is posited between a positive polarity (akomi ke), a negative polarity (NPI) (oute), and a ‘flexible scale’even (esto) which does not introduce likelihood, but is associated with scales made salient by the context. The analysis is a refinement of Rooth’s original idea that NP is involved in the interpretation of English even, and establishes further that the “negative” polarity domain of EVEN includes a sensitivity that is not strictly speaking negative (flexible scale esto). The distributional restrictions of EVEN items are shown to follow from distinct presuppositions (positive polarity and flexible scale EVEN), or from their lexical featural specification (NPI EVEN), a result that squares neatly with the fact that ill-formedness is systematic pragmatic deviance in the former case but robust ungrammaticality in the latter. This result supports the by now widely accepted view that polarity dependencies are not of uniform nature, and that we need to distinguish presupposition failures (which are weaker and possibly fixable in some contexts) from cases of ungrammaticality which are robust and cannot be fixed in any context [Giannakidou A.

Rett proposes that evaluative interpretations result from the presence of a freely-occurring EVAL morpheme which introduces the reference to a contextual standard. According to Rett, whenever a degree construction is obligatorily evaluative, it is because its non-evaluative parse is blocked by a markedness competition. A limit of this proposal is that markedness comes as a stipulation. In this paper, I propose a principled way for generating competing candidates based on the structural complexity of aPs. I introduce the LF-principle Minimize aPs! that penalizes structurally complex degree expressions whenever they have semantically equivalent, yet structurally simpler counterparts. In addition, a PF-filter, Myers' Generalization, is argued to impose a wellformedness condition on morphologically complex expressions, thereby restricting further the set of competitors for semantic competition. The resulting picture regards the solution to the evaluativity puzzle as being at the crossroads of the different modules of the grammar.},

The crucial distinguishing property of shi … de clefts is that they involve no A′ movement. This is linked to the fact that the presupposition in the shi … de focus cleft involves a projection smaller than CP. It thus lacks a landing site for A′ movement and fails to host material such as negation, normally compatible with full CP clefts in languages such as English. The Mandarin pattern shows that the basic semantic property of clefts, bipartioning into focus and presupposition, is logically independent from A′ movement.},

	abstract = {It is well known that real-time human language processing is highly incremental and context-driven, and that the strength of a comprehender’s expectation for each word encountered is a key determinant of the difficulty of integrating that word into the preceding context. In reading, this differential difficulty is largely manifested in the amount of time taken to read each word. While numerous studies over the past thirty years have shown expectation-based effects on reading times driven by lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and other information sources, there has been little progress in establishing the quantitative relationship between expectation (or prediction) and reading times. Here, by combining a state-of-the-art computational language model, two large behavioral data-sets, and non-parametric statistical techniques, we establish for the first time the quantitative form of this relationship, finding that it is logarithmic over six orders of magnitude in estimated predictability. This result is problematic for a number of established models of eye movement control in reading, but lends partial support to an optimal perceptual discrimination account of word recognition. We also present a novel model in which language processing is highly incremental well below the level of the individual word, and show that it predicts both the shape and time-course of this effect. At a more general level, this result provides challenges for both anticipatory processing and semantic integration accounts of lexical predictability effects. And finally, this result provides evidence that comprehenders are highly sensitive to relative differences in predictability – even for differences between highly unpredictable words – and thus helps bring theoretical unity to our understanding of the role of prediction at multiple levels of linguistic structure in real-time language comprehension.},

We show that repair and non-repair effects are attested with both sluicing, which is widely assumed to be island-insensitive, and fragment answers which are widely assumed to be island-sensitive, and we show that only the evasion approach can account for the whole set of facts. We therefore reject the proposal that island conditions are fundamentally phonological in nature and conclude that islands provide a strong argument for theories of ellipsis which posit that ellipsis sites contain syntactic structure.},

	abstract = {The linguistic term prolepsis refers to a construction where a structural complement of the matrix verb is semantically related to the predicate of an embedded clause. In an example like I believe of John that he likes Mary, the proleptic constituent John is related to the position occupied by the coreferential pronoun he.. At first sight one may take the proleptic constituent to be an argument of the matrix verb with the pronoun establishing an anaphoric dependency, but things are more complex. First, the construction is possible with a very wide range of matrix verbs, casting doubt on the argumenthood of the object. Second, a coreferential element is obligatory, which argues against a mere aboutness relationship. There is conflicting evidence concerning the base position of the proleptic object. On the one hand, there is solid evidence from anaphor binding and superiority that the proleptic object occupies an A-position in the matrix clause. On the other hand, the proleptic object reconstructs into the complement clause. This suggests that the proleptic object originates in the embedded clause, but an analysis involving movement from the complement clause fails for conceptual (Improper Movement, Freezing) and empirical (selective reconstruction effects) reasons. It is proposed that these paradoxical properties follow if the proleptic object is licensed by predication. The complement clause involves a base-generated operator which turns it into an open sentence. The coreferential pronoun is the variable bound by the operator. The proleptic object, then, is the subject of the predication. The relationship between the proleptic object and the silent operator involves ellipsis, as does the relationship between the operator and the coreferential pronoun. Ellipsis derives the (selective) reconstruction effects, and predication explains the necessity of a coreferential element.},

	abstract = {This paper strives to characterize the relation between accent placement and discourse in terms of independent constraints operating at the interface between syntax and interpretation. The Givenness Constraint requires un-F-marked constituents to be given. Key here is our definition of givenness, which synthesizes insights from the literature on the semantics of focus with older views on information structure. AvoidF requires speakers to economize on F-marking. A third constraint requires a subset of F-markers to dominate accents.The characteristic prominence patterns of "novelty focus" and "contrastive focus" both arise from a combination of the Givenness Constraint and AvoidF. Patterns of prominence in questions as well as in answers to questions are explained in terms of the constraints, thanks in part to the way in which the Givenness relation is defined. Head/argument asymmetries noted in the literature on Focus Projection are placed in the phonology-syntax interface, independent of discourse conditions. Deaccenting follows when AvoidF is ranked higher than constraint(s) governing head/argument asymmetries.},

It develops the view that the logical forms of simple English sentences typically contain quantification over events or states and shows how this view can account for a wide variety of semantic phenomena.Focusing on the structure of meaning in English sentences at a "subatomic" level - that is, a level below the one most theories accept as basic or "atomic" - Parsons asserts that the semantics of simple English sentences require logical forms somewhat more complex than is normally assumed in natural language semantics. His articulation of underlying event theory explains a wide variety of apparently diverse semantic characteristics of natural language, and his development of the theory shows the importance of seeing the distinction between events and states.Parsons demonstrates that verbs, also, indicate kinds of actions rather than specific, individual actions. Verb phrases, too, he argues, depend on modifiers to make their function and meaning in a sentence specific. An appendix gives many of the details needed to formalize the theory discussed in the body of the text and provides a series of templates that permit the generation of atomic formulas of English.Terence Parsons is Professor of Philosophy and Dean of Humanities at the University of California, Irvine.},

Although certain scholars have argued that acceptability and grammaticality are two separable notions that refer to different concepts, there are contexts in which the two terms are used interchangeably. The present work shows that these two notions and their scales do not coincide: there are sentences that are acceptable, even though they are ungrammatical, and sentences that are unacceptable, despite being grammatical. First we adduce a number of examples for both cases, including grammatical illusions, violations of Identity Avoidance, and sentences that involve a level of processing complexity that overloads the cognitive parser and tricks it into (un)acceptability. We then discuss whether the acceptability of grammatically ill-formed sentences entails that we actually assign a meaning to them. Last, it is shown that there are n ways of unacceptability, and two ways of ungrammaticality, in the absolute and the relative sense. Since the use of the terms ‘acceptable’ and ‘grammatical’ is often found in experiments that constitute the core of the evidential base of linguistics, disentangling their various uses is likely to aid the field reach a better level of terminological clarity.},

	title = {The syntax in {Tlingit} verbs},
	url = {https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0388221},
	abstract = {Tlingit verbs appear to be single phonological words but they are constructed from a large number of distinct morphological elements that correspond to argument structure, event structure, aspect, mood, modality, tense, and qualia. Previous analyses have accounted for the verbal morphology of Tlingit with opaque position class template systems. These systems present the internal structure of verbs as arbitrary and do not address the many dependencies between elements. This dissertation argues that the Tlingit verb implements a regular syntax with each morpheme instantiating a syntactic terminal. Ordering within the verb word is a consequence of regular syntactic structure with all dependencies between elements reflecting selection and agreement phenomena. The verb-internal syntax requires no extraordinary theoretical mechanisms: Tlingit verb morphology is neither unique nor problematic from a theoretical perspective.

To demonstrate this argument, this dissertation develops a formal theoretical model of Tlingit verbal structure within the Minimalist Program framework. An acategorial root forms the basis of the syntactic structure, encoding the majority of lexical properties. Other verbal morphology is either functional heads such as v, Voice, and Asp, or minimal lexical elements such as D pronouns or N incorporates. As well as phonological form and encyclopedic meaning, roots also encode valency, qualia, durativity, stativity, and irrealis, along with other morphosyntactic properties. These properties influence both the syntactic functions and semantic interpretations of the functional heads, so that the syntax and semantics of each head is contextually dependent, fully predictable and compositional. Long distance dependencies arise from selection, movement, and agreement between heads. Every morpheme either saturates or restricts an event or an argument, thus predictably contributing to the structure and interpretation of the whole verb. Movement and spellout are determined by phases which correspond to regular domains in the phonological verb word and phrase. Careful attention is paid to many supposedly irregular or lexical phenomena, showing that most are extensions of regular phenomena, and that some actually reflect underdocumented grammatical patterns. The results of this research have many implications for linguistic theory and for related Na-Dene languages and provide a robust analytical foundation for Tlingit language teaching and revitalization.},

In Part I, the authors develop a continuation-based theory of scope and quantificational binding and provide an explanation for order sensitivity in scope-related phenomena such as scope ambiguity, crossover, superiority, reconstruction, negative polarity licensing, dynamic anaphora, and donkey anaphora. Part II outlines an innovative substructural logic for reasoning about continuations and proposes an analysis of the compositional semantics of adjectives such as 'same' in terms of parasitic and recursive scope. It also shows that certain cases of ellipsis should be treated as anaphora to a continuation, leading to a new explanation for a subtype of sluicing known as sprouting. The book makes a significant contribution to work on scope, reference, quantification, and other central aspects of semantics and will appeal to semanticists in linguistics and philosophy at graduate level and above.},

	abstract = {The simplest form in which gradable adjectives are used—positive constructions, like John is tall—carry an additional semantic component, evaluativity, that is not part of the adjective’s lexicalized meaning. Evaluative constructions require that an entity instantiate a gradable predicate to a significantly high degree. This property holds of John is tall, but it fails to hold of some other adjectival constructions, like John is taller than Bill or John is 6 ft tall. The source of evaluativity has posed a challenge for semantic accounts of adjectives and adjectival constructions, which are tasked with explaining why the most basic use of gradable adjectives doesn’t reflect its core meaning. This book’s author's (2008) EVAL account capitalizes on notions of antonymy and markedness to account for the distribution of evaluativity across adjectival constructions, including the equative, which can be evaluative. This book sets these notions in a neo-Gricean framework of conversational implicature (Horn 1984; Levinson 2000). It presents an account of evaluativity across adjectival constructions as arising in some cases as a Quantity implicature (similar to the meaning attributed to tautologies like War is war) and in other cases as a Manner implicature (similar to the non-truth-conditional content of litotes like not uncommon). It attributes notable differences in where (i.e. matrix/subordinate clauses) and how (i.e. at-issue/not-at-issue content) evaluativity is encoded to the type of implicature and the question under discussion.},

Hai that adjoins to AspP has the additive or temporal meaning. Hai adjoining to DegP is associated with the comparative or marginal meaning. I propose that hai only has one core sense, which is the additive reading (König 1991). By adopting the theory of alternative semantics (Rooth 1992), I propose that the various interpretations of hai result from the interaction between the additive sense, and the focus associate and the focus domain, which are restricted by the syntactic positions of hai.},

	abstract = {Nez Perce is a language  with a dedicated comparative  morpheme and crisp judgments in its comparatives, but with no means to express differential measurement in its comparative.  These data can be captured by two different types of analyses: either Nez Perce has a negative setting of the Degree Semantics Parameter ([±DSP]) (Beck et al., 2009), along with a comparative operator that allows manipulation of context (Klein, 1980), or it has a positive setting of said parameter, but the comparative operator does not provide a slot for a differential degree argument. We show that the “degreeless” analysis of gradable adjectives in Nez Perce provides a unified and simple explanation for a cluster of additional properties of the language. At the same time, our findings draw attention to hitherto unattested variation within degreeless languages: other [-DSP]  languages like Motu (Beck et al., 2009), Washo (Bochnak, 2015) and Warlpiri (Bowler,  2016) lack the Klein-style  comparative operator present in Nez Perce.},

Descriptive work usually discriminate between ‘temporal’ and ‘comparative’ readings of hai, while the semantic core of the adverb has been defined in terms of scalarity. In this paper, our purpose is to give an understanding of the topic by providing the basis for an analysis of the adverb at the syntax-semantics interface. While subscribing to the generalization that hai is restricted to ordered domains, we will propose to characterize the adverb as a repetitive operator, that is, an additive operator the event domain; we will show that the possibility for hai to associate to gradable properties in comparative constructions can be explained on the bases of its repetitive use.},

The empirical side of our discussion focuses on two novel observations: (i) the interactions between prosody and monotonicity, and (ii) what we call presupposed ignorance. In order to account for these observations, our final proposal relies on two mechanisms of scalar strengthening, the Presupposed Ignorance Principle and an exhaustivity operator which lets the presuppositions of negated alternatives project.},

However, the bulk of earlier research supporting their perceptual importance has been conducted primarily with synthetic speech stimuli. The present study examined the acoustic correlates of place of articulation in the voiced formant transitions from natural speech. Linear prediction analysis was used to provide detailed temporal and spectral measurements of the formant transitions for /b,d,g/ paired with eight vowels produced by one talker. Measurements of the transition onset and steady state frequencies, durations, and derived formant loci for F1, F2, and F3 are reported. Analysis of these measures showed little evidence of context invariant acoustic correlates of place. When vowel context was known, most transition parameters were not reliable acoustic correlates of place except for the F2 transition and a two-dimensional representation of F2 X F3 onset frequencies. The results indicated that the information contained in the formant transitions in these natural stop-vowel syllables was not sufficient to distinguish place across all the vowel contexts studied.},

Locus equations cue place indirectly by quantifying directly the degree of coarticulatory overlap (coarticulation resistance) between consonant and vowel. Coarticulation resistance is correlated with place, The experiment tested predictions that when coarticulation resistance varies due to properties of the consonant other than place of articulation (in particular due to manner of articulation), locus equations would not accurately reflect consonantal place of articulation. These predictions were confirmed. In addition, discriminant analyses, using locus equation variables as classifiers, were generally unsuccessful in classifying a set of consonants representing six different places of articulation. I conclude that locus equations are unlikely to provide useful place information to listeners.},

	abstract = {Here are the slides for my talk at the Manchester conference on David Lewis and his Place in the History of Analytic Philosophy, June 17, 2019. The talk looked at David Lewis’s chapter V of Convention and at General Semantics. It focused on those aspects of David Lewis’s semantic work that have had a lasting impact on Formal Semantics, as currently pursued within both Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language: (1) visions about the role of semantics within a theory of grammar, (2) theories of meaning composition, including rule-by-rule interpretation (Convention) and type-driven interpretation (General Semantics), and (3) the interpretation of quantifier phrases as generalized quantifiers. For each of the three areas, I placed David Lewis’s contributions within a historical context, tracking the available tools at the time: a Tarskian semantics, categorial grammars (Ajdukiewicz), the typed lambda-calculus, including types for generalized quantifiers (Church), intensions as functions from possible worlds (construed as state-descriptions) to extensions (Carnap), and generative syntax (Chomsky). The paper concluded by placing Lewis’s contributions to contemporary Formal Semantics next to those by Richard Montague.},

These two types of resumptive pronouns are morphologically distinct: the presence of (local) person features reflects a base-generated derivation and the absence of person features reflects A-bar movement. Crucial data comes from local person pronominal clefts derived from islands (bound pronoun context) and parasitic gaps (movement copy context). Inspired by van Urk (2017), I analyze this pattern using Landau's (2006) theory of chain reduction in which only movement copies create chains and are then subject to an algorithm which deletes person features.},

	abstract = {In Mandarin Chinese, there exists a particular type of construction called “verb doubling cleft construction” (henceforth VDCC) like Chi, (wo) shi chi-guo le, buguo… (literally ‘As for eating, I have indeed eaten, but…’), where the two verbs act as a topic and a verum focus, respectively. Cheng and Vicente (2013) claim that VDCC shares the same internal syntax with regular clefts, based on Cheng (2008)'s proposal that (i) the copula shi ‘be’ takes a small clause, and (ii) the two verbs stand in an A-bar movement relation. In this paper, we present a dynamic account of VDCC within the framework of Dynamic Syntax (Kempson et al., 2001; Cann et al., 2005). Under a parsing-based analysis, the first verb is shown to be an elliptical expression which denotes some event established in previous discourse, and the second verb is also an elliptical expression which needs to recover its content based on the interpretation of the first verb in topic position.},

It is proposed in the paper that resumptive pronouns license parasitic gaps in a language only if they behave syntactically as variables. The existence of parasitic subject gaps in Norwegian turns out to be a natural consequence, given that empty categories in subject position don’t show standard ECP effects in this language. In the final section, it is shown how a modified version of Kayne’s (connectedness condition can account for the distribution of empty categories in Swedish.},

For several years, Andrew Marantz, a New Yorker staff writer, has been embedded in two worlds. The first is the world of social-media entrepreneurs, who, acting out of naïvete and reckless ambition, upended all traditional means of receiving and transmitting information. The second is the world of the people he calls "the gate crashers"--the conspiracists, white supremacists, and nihilist trolls who have become experts at using social media to advance their corrosive agenda. Antisocial ranges broadly--from the first mass-printed books to the trending hashtags of the present; from secret gatherings of neo-Fascists to the White House press briefing room--and traces how the unthinkable becomes thinkable, and then how it becomes reality. Combining the keen narrative detail of Bill Buford's Among the Thugs and the sweep of George Packer's The Unwinding,  Antisocial reveals how the boundaries between technology, media, and politics have been erased, resulting in a deeply broken informational landscape--the landscape in which we all now live. Marantz shows how alienated young people are led down the rabbit hole of online radicalization, and how fringe ideas spread--from anonymous corners of social media to cable TV to the President's Twitter feed. Marantz also sits with the creators of social media as they start to reckon with the forces they've unleashed. Will they be able to solve the communication crisis they helped bring about, or are their interventions too little too late?},

	isbn = {978-0-19-968435-9},
	abstract = {This book considers the implications of cross-linguistic word-order patterns for linguistic theory. One of the salient results of Joseph Greenberg's pioneering work in language typology was the notion of a 'harmonic' word-order type, whereby if the verb appears at the left or right edge of the verb phrase, other heads (e.g. prepositions, nouns) also tend to do so. Today, however, there is recognition in both the typological and generative literature that very many, and possibly even the majority of languages, fail to be fully harmonic in the sense that all head-complement pairs pattern alike. But does this imply limitless variation? The chapters in this volume, written by international scholars, discuss the issues arising from this basic question, drawing on data from typologically distinct disharmonic languages, including Mandarin Chinese, Basque, Mócheno (a Tyrolean variety spoken in Northern Italy), French, English, Hixkaryana (a Cariban language), Khalkha Mongolian, Uyghur Turkic, and Afrikaans. The volume begins with a substantial introduction to the study of word order and its relation to linguistic theory. It is then divided into sections on the nature of disharmony; the role of prosody; the question of Antisymmetry and novel alternatives to Antisymmetry; and the Final-over-Final Constraint. Aside from introducing new empirical findings, the volume also offers a range of new perspectives on disharmonic word orders, the status of word order in linguistic theory, and theoretical accounts of typological gaps.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010PhDT.......126A},
	abstract = {Lexical-tone languages use fundamental frequency (F0/pitch) to convey 
word meaning. About 41.8\% of the world's languages use lexical tone
(Maddieson, 2008), yet those systems are under-studied. I aim to
increase our understanding of speech-sound inventory organization by
extending to tone-systems a model of vowel-system organization, the
Theory of Adaptive Dispersion (TAD) (Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972).
This is a cross-language investigation of whether and how the size of a
tonal inventory affects (A) acoustic tone-space size and (B) dispersion
of tone categories within the tone-space. I compared five languages with
very different tone inventories: Cantonese (3 contour, 3 level tones);
Mandarin (3 contour, 1 level tone); Thai (2 contour, 3 level tones);
Yoruba (3 level tones only); and Igbo (2 level tones only). Six native
speakers (3 female) of each language produced 18 CV syllables in
isolation, with each of his/her language's tones, six times. I measured
tonal F0 across the vowel at onset, midpoint, and offglide. Tone-space
size was the F0 difference in semitones (ST) between each language's
highest and lowest tones. Tone dispersion was the F0 distance (ST)
between two tones shared by multiple languages. Following the TAD, I
predicted that languages with larger tone inventories would have larger
tone-spaces. Against expectations, tone-space size was fixed across
level-tone languages at midpoint and offglide, and across contour-tone
languages (except Thai) at offglide. However, within each language type
(level-tone vs. contour-tone), languages with smaller tone inventories
had larger tone spaces at onset. Tone-dispersion results were also
unexpected. The Cantonese mid-level tone was further dispersed from a
tonal baseline than the Yoruba mid-level tone; Cantonese mid-level tone
dispersion was therefore greater than theoretically necessary. The
Cantonese high-level tone was also further dispersed from baseline than
the Mandarin high-level tone -- at midpoint and offglide only. The TAD
cannot account for these results. A follow-up analysis indicates that
tone-space size differs as a function of tone-language type: level-tone
and contour-tone systems may not be comparable. Another analysis plots
tones in an onset F0 x offglide F0 space (following Barry and Blamey,
2004). Preliminary results indicate that the languages' tones are
well-separated in this space.},

In this framework, items are organized in a space comprised of one or more dimensions along which they can be compared. The items’ graded membership is established by their relative proximity in this space to the prototypical instances of contrasting concepts. Because dimensional adjectives can be applied to an indefinite variety of things and grammatically have no upper bound to serve as cognitive reference point, they have been argued to lack prototypes. We present the results of an empirical study showing that the conceptual spaces framework can nevertheless be extended successfully to dimensional adjectives by complementing them with a comparison class argument (such as short/tall for an adult man and cheap/expensive for a smartphone), allowing participants to retrieve meaningful prototypical instances, which can be used to establish membership degree. Since dimensional adjectives are subjective, we investigate how the framework can accommodate interindividual variability in membership degree judgments. We find that the predictions of the framework significantly improve if prototypical instances themselves are assumed to come with a gradient instead of being considered equally typical, thereby providing a more fine-grained account of typicality and furthering the development of the conceptual spaces framework.},

After presenting several approaches which make crucial use of VERUM, the concept of truth and its linguistic realization in clausal structures is discussed. This leads to a perspective that connects verum focus to the part of the sentence that spells out the intention of the sentence meaning: the sentence mood. This line of reasoning intends to promote the view that verum focus can be derived from the systematic interaction of sentence mood with the regular properties of focus assignment.},

The distinctive features of DRT, to be discussed below, are that it is a mentalist and representationalist theory of interpretation, and that it is a theory of the interpretation not only of individual sentences but of discourse, as well. In these respects DRT made a clear break with classical formal semantics, which during the 1970s had emanated from Montague's pioneering work (Thomason 1974), but in other respects it continued the tradition, e.g., in its use of model-theoretical tools. In the meantime, DRT has come to serve as a framework for explaining a wide range of phenomena, but we will confine our attention to fewer than a handful: anaphora, tense, presupposition, and propositional attitudes.

	abstract = {Copy raising sentences (Charlie looks like his prospects are bright) are ambiguous between a thematic and a nonthematic reading for the subject, corresponding to whether or not it is the perceptual source. On the basis of Hebrew and English data, this paper motivates a novel generalization: a pronominal copy in the complement is necessary if and only if the matrix subject is not thematic. This follows if (i) a nonthematic DP must be licensed by predication, (ii) the clausal complement is turned into a predicate by merging with a null operator, and (iii) the pronominal copy is the variable required by the operator. Contra previous analyses, I argue that the complement in copy raising may be propositional, forming an “aboutness” relation with the subject. When it is predicative, however, a null operator is necessary, since CPs are not natural predicates. The dichotomy between propositional and predicative CPs cuts across the gap/copy distinction, and is manifested in other constructions, also discussed (hanging topic vs. left dislocation, rationale vs. purpose clauses, and proleptic object constructions).},

A novel account of these two phenomena is proposed, according to which all occurrences of phi-features are both semantically and morphologically relevant. For such a ‘uniformly semantic account’ of phi-features, dependent plural pronouns constitute a theoretical challenge, while partial binding is more or less straightforwardly accounted for. In order to make sense of the semantic effects of the phi-features on dependent plural pronouns, the following idea is pursued: the phi-features on a dependent plural pronoun reflect the range of values that the pronoun takes, rather than the particular value it denotes at a time. This idea is implemented in a compositional semantics by making use of (Skolemized) choice functions. An appealing feature of the present account is that, unlike its predecessors, it accounts for dependent plural pronouns without c-commanding antecedents in essentially the same way as for those with c-commanding antecedents. It is also shown how this account of dependent plural pronouns can straightforwardly be augmented with set indices to account for partial binding.},

It
is natural to make this assumption in possible worlds semantics, but is not necessarily motivated in a more fine-grained theory of meaning.

This raises the question of what is actually being expressed if we say that a constituent is focused in a particular language, and whether, or to what extent, the same semantic or pragmatic content is formally expressed by focus-marking across languages. This special issue addresses the question of focus and its grammatical realization from a number of theoretical and empirical perspectives. In this introductory article we elaborate on this question by making an explicit proposal about what we take to be the correct way of thinking about the information-structural category of focus and its formal realization. In the first part, we introduce a unified semantico-pragmatic perspective on focus in terms of alternatives and possible worlds. In the second part, we present a cursory cross-linguistic overview of focus marking strategies as found in the languages of the world. Finally, in the third part, we discuss the connection between the notion of focus, different pragmatic uses of focus and different focus marking strategies employed in the grammars of natural languages.},

We provide further support for their position with data from Mandarin and Turkish-language judgment tasks which examined the acceptability of resumptive pronouns (RPs) in relative clauses. Based on previous studies which relied on informal judgments, we expected that RPs should be permitted in certain types of Mandarin relative clauses, but ungrammatical in comparable Turkish relative clauses. The results failed to replicate this contrast: RPs were more acceptable than expected in Turkish, and less acceptable than expected in Mandarin. Furthermore, the Mandarin Chinese experiment showed an unexpected gradient effect. We argue that these results challenge existing theoretical accounts, support the more widespread adoption of experimental tasks in theoretical linguistics and in second-language research, and consistently support the Filler-Gap Domain complexity ranking as proposed by Hawkins (2004, Efficiency and complexity in grammars, Oxford: Oxford University Press). We use the complexity ranking and its supporting evidence as a case study demonstrating that quantitative data, such as the evidence obtained from formal sentence judgment tasks, are indispensable in the defense or criticism of linguistic theories.},

The effects are claimed in many different languages. In “destruction of the city” the logical object of the noun is affected and can appear as the possessive, but in “knowledge of history” it cannot. One mechanism for describing the effect is making affectedness a semantic primitive which constrains the subcategorization frames. Another system uses features. Another makes affectedness a constraint on possible theta-grids. In another there is a thematic hierarchy which dictates that the affected patient will be the external argument. This connection between the semantic notion of affectedness and the closeness of the connection between the complement and the head is the most salient feature of the different approaches. Experimental work adds weight to the idea that affectedness is a semantic primitive.},

	abstract = {Contraction is a descriptive term for phenomena in which one word is reduced and apparently affixed to another. Two types of contraction have been particularly prominent in the syntax literature. The first, wanna-contraction, refers to the use of wanna in place of want to. There are a number of interesting ways in which wanna-contraction appears to rely on aspects of the syntactic structure. The most celebrated of these is that contraction is not possible across a trace of A′-movement, but at a more general level, at least descriptively, the contracted form is allowed only in subject control environments (i.e. when want subcategorizes for a controlled clause of which to is the head). The second major type of contraction that has played a role in the syntax literature is finite auxiliary contraction, which refers to forms like we have becoming we've. Unlike wanna-contraction, finite auxiliary contraction does not seem to be sensitive to the presence of intervening traces and is not associated with subject control environments. Nonetheless, it is subject to restrictions that give the appearance of being syntactic. A well-known example of this is that contraction is not possible when the auxiliary has a trace or a deletion site to its right. In both of these types of contraction, some analyses have attempted to account for the restrictions directly within the syntax, while others have made use of the way that syntactic structure interfaces with phonological phrasing.},

	abstract = {Sentences containing quantifiers are often ambiguous, as quantificational DPs interact with one another, and with wh-phrases, negation, and adverbials. This kind of ambiguity is an ambiguity with respect to the scope of the quantifiers. However, sentences containing several quantifiers or operators are not always scope ambiguous: compare, for example, the ambiguous Some of us always showed up with the unequivocal Always, some of us showed up. Thus, the scope of quantifiers is not essentially free; there is a complex pattern of ambiguous and unequivocal sentences containing quantifiers and operators. An adequate analysis of scope ambiguities should be able to predict this complex pattern in a principled way, which should encompass a sensible view of the interface between syntax and semantics. According to the dominant view in generative grammar, scope relations can be deduced from the c-command relations on Logical Form, where quantifiers are assigned scope by quantifier raising. Variants of and alternatives to this dominant view have been proposed, for some partly motivated by the scope facts in languages other than English (in particular, Mandarin Chinese and Hungarian have been taken into consideration), and for some partly motivated by a more thorough look at the (English) data and/or by modification or substitution of the basic framework. It became apparent that quantifier scope relations crucially depend on certain properties of the quantifiers, whose exact nature is not yet settled, however. The interplay of these properties seems to determine the complex pattern of ambiguous and unequivocal sentences containing quantifiers and operators. The challenge is to uncover the nature of these scope-relevant properties and account for their interplay within a general conception of the interface between syntax and semantics.},

	abstract = {In many languages modal auxiliaries such as English can, must, may, need, will, ought, want are ambiguous between two types of interpretations: epistemic and root interpretations. In the epistemic interpretation the modal expresses how likely it is that a proposition is true (for example, necessarily, possibly, probably true) while in the root interpretations the modal expresses the obligatoriness, permissibility, desirability, or possibility of a state or event. A central question in much syntactic research on modal auxiliaries has been whether this systematic semantic ambiguity corresponds to a syntactic distinction. A commonly accepted answer has been that in epistemic interpretations the modal verb is a monadic predicate while in root interpretations it is a dyadic predicate, typically a relation between a subject and an infinitival verb. This distinction between monadic and dyadic modal predicates has been modeled syntactically in various ways: (i) in terms of lexical argument structure, that is, as the distinction between raising and control verbs; (ii) in terms of different base positions in the array of functional heads making up the clausal spine, with epistemic modals being higher than root modals; (iii) in terms of a higher syntactic position for epistemically interpreted modals after raising at the level of semantic interpretation (LF raising); (iv) in terms of the nature of the complement of the modal. This chapter evaluates these proposals, drawing on data from, among others, English, Dutch, Icelandic, German, and Catalan and taking into account cross-linguistic differences in the modal systems. One important conclusion is that the alleged correspondence between the epistemic/root distinction and the raising/control distinction is too simple, as there are sentences with root interpretations but a raising syntax. The chapter ends with a list of questions for future research.},

	abstract = {"On Resumptive Pronouns in Slavic" is a first step toward a generalized theory of pronouns that accounts for the behavior of both ordinary and resumptive pronouns. I adopt the definition of resumption proposed by Boeckx (2003) who analyzes resumptive pronouns as pronouns stranded by the movement of an NP sister. In contrast to Boeckx's theory, I argue that every definite pronoun enters the syntax as a D{\textless}super{\textgreater}0{\textless}/super{\textgreater} sister to its NP or DP referent. 
								
		[DP her [DP the linguist ] ]
								
The central argument of the dissertation rests on this proposed universal pronominal structure, called the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}stacked DP{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, which consists of a maximal DP (DP{\textless}super{\textgreater}MAX{\textless}/super{\textgreater}) containing a pronominal D{\textless}super{\textgreater}0{\textless}/super{\textgreater} and an internal DP (DP{\textless}super{\textgreater}INT{\textless}/super{\textgreater}). I suggest that the single parametric difference resulting in resumptive vs. non-resumptive type languages is the ability of the internal DP to raise independently of the pronoun. In other words, any language in which the DP{\textless}super{\textgreater}INT{\textless}/super{\textgreater} is independently mobile (i.e. it can move without pied-piping the pronoun) will contain resumptive pronouns.
								
This analysis of the syntactic structure of pronouns extends to all instances of pronouns, including those that do not occur in a resumptive context. A natural question to follow from this is what becomes of the NP/DP sister of the pronoun in contexts not involving any resumption, as in the following sentence: 
								
(i) I met her yesterday.
								
I propose that the NP/DP referent is frequently deleted by a PF operation, Pronominal Associate Deletion (PAD):
								
	If D{\textless}super{\textgreater}0{\textless}/super{\textgreater} is a personal pronoun and XP is a sister to D{\textless}super{\textgreater}0{\textless}/super{\textgreater}, then XP is deleted.
								
If the XP referent raises during narrow syntax, the conditions for PAD will not be met at PF. As a result, both the XP and the pronoun will be pronounced.    
								
In addition to this PF rule, I propose an LF condition to account for the interpretation of pronouns, the Pronominal Reference Condition (PRC):
								
	In DP{\textless}super{\textgreater}MAX{\textless}/super{\textgreater} whose D{\textless}super{\textgreater}0{\textless}/super{\textgreater} is a pronoun, interpret D{\textless}super{\textgreater}0{\textless}/super{\textgreater} as co-referential with the NP also dominated by DP{\textless}super{\textgreater}MAX{\textless}/super{\textgreater}.
								
These two operations, in combination with the stacked DP internal structure of pronouns, provide the means to explain a wide array of phenomena relating to the occurrence of resumptive pronouns, including Macedonian clitic doubling, Hebrew interrogative {\textless}italic{\textgreater}wh{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-resumption, optional resumption in B/C/S and Slovak, and resumption in Slovene superlative clauses.},

A relative clause formed of a chain that ends in a trace triggers functional/pair-list readings regardless of the type of sentence which embeds the relative clause. On the other hand, a relative clause formed of a chain that ends in a pronoun needs to be embedded in an equative sentence in order to trigger such readings. This effect is argued to follow from the constraints which govern resumptive pronouns, one of which being that they require salient discourse antecedents.

The limitations have to do with whether or not the dimension tracks relevant part-whole relations. An analogy is made between these constraints and the well-known constraints on thematic relations that are incurred by the position of a noun phrase in a clause. A proposal is made about the meanings of expressions like too much and 2 pounds which explains their common cross-categorial distribution and this informs the analysis of their use in noun phrases. A position is taken on the meaning of the count mass distinction which, in conjunction with the hypothesis about dimensions, explains asymmetries in the distribution of prenominal adjectives with count and mass nouns.},

	abstract = {This volume provides a guide to what we know about the interplay between prosody-stress, phrasing, and melody-and interpretation-felicity in discourse, inferences, and emphasis. Speakers can modulate the meaning and effects of their utterances by changing the location of stress or of pauses, and by choosing the melody of their sentences. Although these factors often do not change the literal meaning of what is said, linguists have in recent years found tools and models to describe these more elusive aspects of linguistic meaning. This volume provides a guide to what we know about the interplay between prosody-stress, phrasing, and melody-and interpretation-felicity in discourse, inferences, and emphasis. Daniel Buring presents the main phenomena involved, and introduces the details of current formal analyses of prosodic structure, relevant aspects of discourse structure, intonational meaning, and, most importantly, the relations between them. He explains and compares the most influential theories in these areas, and outlines the questions that remain open for future research.This wide-ranging book involves aspects of phonetics, phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, and will be of interest to researchers and students in all of these fields, from advanced undergraduate level upwards.},

However, psycholinguistic studies have typically compared RP and illicit gap conditions indirectly. We posit that RP island amelioration in comprehension is undetectable when participants cannot compare alternative sentences, and thus that the apparent production/comprehension split arises from methodological differences between perception and production experiments., We present six experiments crossing three island types in two tasks (full-sentence forced choice and forced-choice fill-in-the-blank), manipulating gap location (island vs. nonisland). We find that RPs are preferred in islands and gaps in nonislands (p = .0001). This suggests that RPs do ameliorate island violations and that the production/comprehension split is a methodological artifact.},

This paper argues that an approach first proposed by David Lewis must be pursued: the ‘if’-clause in these sentences restricts the quantifier. Only the Lewis-style analysis can deal with sentences involving non-universal quantifiers such as ‘Most letters are answered if they are shorter than 5 pages’. I show that Barker's reasons for rejecting the restrictor analysis are not cogent and that the restrictor analysis connects widely with recent work in natural language semantics.},

Supporting the view that grammar is restricted by economy considerations, Fox argues for various economy conditions that constrain the application of "covert" operations. Among other things, he argues that syntactic operations that do not affect phonology cannot apply unless they affect the semantic interpretation of a sentence. This position has a number of consequences for the architecture of grammar. For example, it suggests that the modularity assumption, according to which a language's syntax must be characterized independently of its semantics, needs to be revised. Another consequence concerns new answers to the question of exactly where in the syntactic derivation the various constraints on interpretation apply.

In the universal construction in Japanese, the restrictor (provided by an indeterminate phrase) sometimes appears to be separate from the universal particle mo. It is proposed that quantification at a distance is only apparent, and that the restriction is in fact provided locally by the sister constituent of mo as a whole. The proposal leads us to a straightforward uniform picture of the syntax-semantics mapping of the universal construction and wh-questions, building upon Hamblin’s (1973) semantics for wh-phrases as sets of alternatives. It allows for a switch of perspective on a long-standing puzzle regarding locality effects in the indeterminate–particle association by deriving the locality pattern from the way indeterminate phrases are interpreted and associated with particles, without any stipulations.},

The present study examined this assumption with one production and three perception experiments. The production experiment compared duration, intensity, formants and spectral tilt of phonated and whispered Mandarin monosyllabic utterances with four lexical tones spoken as either statements or questions. For tones, no acoustic properties were found to occur only in whispered but not in phonated utterances. For intonation, some spectral tilt measurements differed between the two phonation types. The two tone perception experiments used phonated and whispered utterances as well as amplitude-modulated noise based on those utterances as stimuli. Results show that once turned into amplitude-modulated noise, phonated and whispered tones had similar identification patterns, indicating that the non-F0 tonal cues in whispers were already in phonated speech. The intonation perception experiment used original utterances as stimuli and showed a substantial drop in overall identification rate and an overwhelming bias towards statement. Thus the spectral tilt differences found in the acoustic analysis were not helpful for intonation perception. Possible reasons for the lack of effective enhancement in whispered speech were discussed.},

Two experiments explore how listeners perceive Mandarin monosyllables in which all or part of the F0 information has been neutralized. In Experiment 1, supposedly critical portions of the tonal pattern were neutralized with signal processing techniques, yet identification of the tonal pattern remained quite good. In Experiment 2, even more drastic removal of tonal information was tested, using stimuli whispered by Mandarin speakers, or signal processed to remove the pitch cues. Again, performance was surprisingly good, showing that listeners can use secondary cues when the primary cue is unavailable. Moreover, a comparison of tone perception of naturally whispered monosyllables and the signal processed ones suggests that Mandarin speakers promote the utility of secondary cues when they know that the primary cue will be unavailable. The flexible use of cues to tone in Mandarin is similar to the flexibility that has been found in the production and perception of cues to phonetic identity in Western languages.},

	abstract = {In this paper I argue for a new constraint on questions, namely that a question denotation (a set of propositions) must map to a partition of a Stalnakerian Context-Set by point-wise exhaustification (point-wise application of the function Exh). The presupposition that Dayal attributes to an Answer operator follows from this constraint, if we assume a fairly standard definition of Exh (Krifka, 1995). But the constraint is more restrictive thereby deriving the sensitivity of higher order quantification to negative islands (Spector, 2008). Moreover, when combined with recent proposals about the nature of Exh – designed primarily to account for the conjunctive interpretation of disjunction (e.g. Bar-Lev and Fox, 2017) – Dayal’s presupposition follows only in certain environments. This observation allows for an account of the “mention-some” interpretation of questions that makes specific distributional predictions.},

In particular, variations in the four Mandarin tones due to anticipatory and carry-over effects are analyzed by examining the time course off0contours of bi-tonal sequences. Using balanced nonsense sequences produced in different carriers with balanced tonal structures, this study establishes a baseline for local contextual tonal variation in Mandarin. It is found that anticipatory and carry-over tonal influences differ both in magnitude and in nature. Carry-over effects are mostly assimilatory: thestarting f0of a tone is assimilated to theoffsetvalue of a previous tone. Anticipatory effects, on the other hand, are mostly dissimilatory: a lowonsetvalue of a tone raises themaximum f0value of a preceding tone. While the magnitude of the carry-over effect is large, anticipatory effects are relatively small.},

Twenty-eight merging participants and thirty control participants in Hong Kong were recruited for a perception experiment. Both accuracy rate and reaction time data were collected. Seventeen merging participants also participated in a production experiment. Predictive discriminant analysis of the fundamental frequency data and judgments by native transcribers were used to assess production accuracy. Results show that the merging participants still had six tone categories in production, although their “tone space” was more reduced. Tones with lower type frequency were more prone to change. The merging group was significantly slower in tone perception than the control group was. In illustrating the patterns of the ongoing tone merging process in Cantonese, this study contributes to a better understanding of the forces of sound change in general.},

Our corpus investigations provide examples of RNR with verb form mismatch with and without syncretism in English and French. Two acceptability experiments show that lack of phonological identity does not affect the acceptability of RNR. We argue further that RNR without phonological identity cannot be taken to be a case of cataphoric VP-ellipsis in French and that it should not be analyzed as such in English. As regards the status of RNR with verb form mismatch, two positions are available: either it is considered to be grammatical, in which case the phonological resolution principle of Pullum \&amp; Zwicky (1986) does not hold, or it is considered to be ungrammatical but repaired (or “recycled”, Arregui et al. 2006; Frazier 2013). The high acceptability of cases with mismatch compared with ungrammatical controls casts doubt on the applicability of the recycling hypothesis in such cases. In order to account for the broader range of data established by our corpus and experimental results, we propose a new analysis of RNR based on lexeme identity rather than form identity.},

(2015) term the “clockwise tone shift cycle:” low {\textgreater} falling {\textgreater} high level or rising-falling {\textgreater} rising {\textgreater} falling-rising or low. The present study addresses three follow-up questions: (1) Are tone changes like those seen in Bangkok Thai also attested in other languages? (2) What other tone changes are repeated across multiple languages? (3) What phonetic biases are most likely to be the origins of the reported changes? A typological review of 52 tone change studies across 45 Sinitic, Tai-Kadai, Hmong-Mien, and Tibeto-Burman languages reveals that clockwise changes are by far the most common. The paper concludes by exploring how tonal truncation (Xu 2017) generates synchronic variation that matches the diachronic patterns; this suggests that truncation is a key mechanism in tone change.},

	abstract = {Predicates such as tall or to know Latin, which intuitively denote permanent properties, are called individual-level predicates. Many peculiar properties of this class of predicates have been noted in the literature. One such property is that we cannot say \#John is sometimes tall. Here is a way to account for this property: this sentence sounds odd because it triggers the scalar implicature that the alternative John is always tall is false, which cannot be, given that, if John is sometimes tall, then he always is. This intuition faces two challenges. First: this scalar implicature has a weird nature, since it must be surprisingly robust (otherwise, it could be cancelled and the sentence rescued) and furthermore blind to the common knowledge that tallness is a permanent property (since this piece of common knowledge makes the two alternatives equivalent). Second: it is not clear how this intuition could be extended to other, more complicated properties of individual-level predicates. The goal of this paper is to defend the idea of an implicature-based theory of individual-level predicates by facing these two challenges. In the first part of the paper, I try to make sense of the weird nature of these special mismatching implicatures within the recent grammatical framework for scalar implicatures of Chierchia (Structures and beyond, 2004) and Fox (2007). In the second part of the paper, I show how this implicature-based line of reasoning can be extended to more complicated properties of individual-level predicates, such as restrictions on the interpretation of their bare plural subjects, noted in Carlson (Reference to kinds in English. Doctoral dissertation, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1977), Milsark (Linguistic Analysis 3.1: 1–29, 1977), and Fox (Natural Language Semantics 3: 283–341, 1995); restrictions on German word order, noted in Diesing (Indefinites, 1992); and restrictions on Q-adverbs, noted in Kratzer (The Generic Book, ed.

	abstract = {A variety of studies have demonstrated that organizing stimuli into categories can affect the way the stimuli are perceived. We explore the influence of categories on perception through one such phenomenon, the perceptual magnet effect, in which discriminability between vowels is reduced near prototypical vowel sounds. We present a Bayesian model to explain why this reduced discriminability might occur: It arises as a consequence of optimally solving the statistical problem of perception in noise. In the optimal solution to this problem, listeners’ perception is biased toward phonetic category means because they use knowledge of these categories to guide their inferences about speakers’ target productions. Simulations show that model predictions closely correspond to previously published human data, and novel experimental results provide evidence for the predicted link between perceptual warping and noise. The model unifies several previous accounts of the perceptual magnet effect and provides a framework for exploring categorical effects in other domains.

In a nutshell, I claim that a bare plural noun like horses denotes the set of individuals, be they atomic or complex, whose atomic parts are individual horses, and that the at-least-two-reading that one gets in sentences such as John has seen horses in the garden is an implicature that derives from the comparison of this sentence with John has seen a horse in the garden. In terms of its literal meaning, the latter sentence is true if and only if John has seen at least one horse in the garden, but gets pragmatically strengthened into John has seen exactly one horse in the garden (scalar implicature). As a result, John has seen horses in the garden will implicate the negation of John has seen exactly one horse in the garden, so that it will end up meaning John has seen several horses. I give an explicit formalization of the processes that lead to higher-order implicatures, based on the possibility of iterating an exhaustivity operator. The proposal accounts for the readings of plural indefinites in various linguistic contexts (monotone-decreasing contexts, non-monotonic contexts, and universally quantified contexts).},

We depart from Lewis,s analysis, however, in claiming that if-clauses, like Strawsonian definite descriptions, refer. We develop our analysis by drawing both on Stalnaker,s Selection Function theory of conditionals and on von Heusinger,s Choice Function theory of definiteness, and by generalizing their analyses to plural Choice/Selection Functions. Finally, we explore some consequences of this referential approach: being definites, if-clauses can be topicalized; the word then can be analyzed as a pronoun that doubles the referential term; the syntactician,s Binding Theory constrains possible anaphoric relations between the if-clause and the word then; and general systems of referential classification can be applied to situate the denotation of the descriptive term, yielding a distinction between indicative, subjunctive and ‘double subjunctive’ conditionals.},

Now the new developments in mathematical tools, the recent interest of physicists in thetheory of disordered matter, the new insights into and psychological models of how the brain works,and the evolution of fast computers that can simulate networks of automata have given Perceptronsnew importance.Witnessing the swing of the intellectual pendulum, Minsky and Papert have added a newchapter in which they discuss the current state of parallel computers, review developments since theappearance of the 1972 edition, and identify new research directions related to connectionism.

This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way.

	abstract = {A good book may have the power to change the way we see the world, but a great book actually becomes part of our daily consciousness, pervading our thinking to the point that we take it for granted, and we forget how provocative and challenging its ideas once were—and still are. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach.  With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don’t arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of “normal science,” as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age.  This new edition of Kuhn’s essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn’s ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking’s introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science.},

It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of data science for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in in a massive open online course (MOOC). This new edition has been updated for Python 3, reorganized to make it easier to use for courses that cover only a subset of the material, and offers additional material including five new chapters.Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming. This edition offers expanded material on statistics and machine learning and new chapters on Frequentist and Bayesian statistics.},

	isbn = {978-1-63149-084-2},
	shorttitle = {The {Tides} of {Mind}},
	abstract = {A “rock star” (New York Times) of the computing world provides a radical new work on the meaning of human consciousness. The holy grail of psychologists and scientists for nearly a century has been to understand and replicate both human thought and the human mind. In fact, it's what attracted the now-legendary computer scientist and AI authority David Gelernter to the discipline in the first place. As a student and young researcher in the 1980s, Gelernter hoped to build a program with a dial marked "focus." At maximum "focus," the program would "think" rationally, formally, reasonably. As the dial was turned down and "focus" diminished, its "mind" would start to wander, and as you dialed even lower, this artificial mind would start to free-associate, eventually ignoring the user completely as it cruised off into the mental adventures we know as sleep. While the program was a only a partial success, it laid the foundation for The Tides of Mind, a groundbreaking new exploration of the human psyche that shows us how the very purpose of the mind changes throughout the day. Indeed, as Gelernter explains, when we are at our most alert, when reasoning and creating new memories is our main mental business, the mind is a computer-like machine that keeps emotion on a short leash and attention on our surroundings. As we gradually tire, however, and descend the "mental spectrum," reasoning comes unglued. Memory ranges more freely, the mind wanders, and daydreams grow more insistent. Self-awareness fades, reflection blinks out, and at last we are completely immersed in our own minds. With far-reaching implications, Gelernter’s landmark "Spectrum of Consciousness" finally helps decode some of the most mysterious wonders of the human mind, such as the numinous light of early childhood, why dreams are so often predictive, and why sadism and masochism underpin some of our greatest artistic achievements. It’s a theory that also challenges the very notion of the mind as a machine—and not through empirical studies or "hard science" but by listening to our great poets and novelists, who have proven themselves as humanity's most trusted guides to the subjective mind and inner self. In the great introspective tradition of Wilhelm Wundt and René Descartes, David Gelernter promises to not only revolutionize our understanding of what it means to be human but also to help answer many of our most fundamental questions about the origins of creativity, thought, and consciousness.},

	abstract = {In 1962, the publication of Thomas Kuhn’s Structure ‘revolutionized’ the way one conducts philosophical and historical studies of science. Through the introduction of both memorable and controversial notions, such as paradigms, scientific revolutions, and incommensurability, Kuhn argued against the traditionally accepted notion of scientific change as a progression towards the truth about nature, and instead substituted the idea that science is a puzzle solving activity, operating under paradigms, which become discarded after it fails to respond accordingly to anomalous challenges and a rival paradigm. Kuhn’s Structure has sold over 1.4 million copies and the Times Literary Supplement named it one of the “Hundred Most Influential Books since the Second World War.” Now, fifty years after this groundbreaking work was published, this volume offers a timely reappraisal of the legacy of Kuhn’s book and an investigation into what Structure offers philosophical, historical, and sociological studies of science in the future.},

Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called “Divide-and-Conquer”), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many exercises and problems have been added for this edition. The international paperback edition is no longer available; the hardcover is available worldwide.},

McFadden (Ed.), Springer-Verlag, 1980. The choice of the particular topic of the second conference was motivated by the belief that the state of knowledge of speech production had recently reached a critical mass, and that a good deal was to be gained from bringing together the foremost researchers in this field. The benefits were the opportunity for the participants to compare notes on their common problems, the publication of a monograph giving a comprehensive state-of-the-art picture of this research area, and the provision of enormous intellectual stimulus for local students of this topic.},

At MIT in 1974, Vergnaud (now holder of the Andrew W. Mellon Professorship in Humanities at the University of Southern California) made a proposal in his Ph.D. thesis that has since become, in somewhat modified form, the standard analysis for the derivation of relative clauses. Vergnaud later integrated the proposal within a broader theory of movement and abstract case. These topics have remained central to theoretical linguistics. In this volume, essays by leading theoretical linguists attest to the importance of Jean-Roger Vergnaud's contributions to linguistics. The essays first discuss issues in syntax, documenting important breakthroughs in the development of the principles and parameters framework and including a famous letter (unpublished until recently) from Vergnaud to Noam Chomsky and Howard Lasnik commenting on the first draft of their 1977 paper "Filters and Controls." Vergnaud's writings on phonology (which, the editors write, "take a definite syntactic turn") have also been influential, and the volume concludes with two contributions to that field. The essays, rewarding from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, not only offer insight into Vergnaud's impact on the field but also describe current work on the issues he introduced into the scholarly debate.

Over the past fifty years, this framework has sparked an explosion of inquiry into a wide range of languages, and has yielded some major theoretical questions. The final chapter revisits the key issues, reviewing the 'biolinguistic' approach that has guided Chomsky's work from its origins to the present day, and raising some novel and exciting challenges for the study of language and mind.},

A briefly displayed prime verb (duration of 39 ms) appeared immediately prior to reading the main verb, and had a significant impact on syntactic misanalysis effects for the ambiguous sentence complement. Priming the matrix verb with a verb that tends to be used with a direct object (e.g., ``obtained'') resulted in increased processing difficulty in the disambiguating region of the sentence complement (e.g., ``could''). Priming the matrix verb with a verb that tends to be used with a sentence complement (e.g., ``realized'') resulted in significantly less processing difficulty in the disambiguating region. The results are consistent with constraint-based theories of sentence processing that make immediate use of lexically specific information.},

(2001) among others). From this assumption, the aim of our paper is twofold. Firstly, we present novel data from French and Jordanian Arabic involving resumption that clearly argue for reconstruction within strong islands, hence casting doubt on the traditional generalization. Secondly, we propose to modify the traditional analysis about reconstruction in the following way: if an XP allows for reconstruction, a copy of that XP (rather than movement of that XP) shoud be present. More precisely, we argue that unexpected cases of reconstruction within strong islands just follow from the NP-deletion’s analysis of pronouns (see Elbourne (2001)) applied to resumption.},

It provides support for the view that restrictive relative clauses are structurally ambiguous between two structures: the head-internal, raising structure and the matching structure, which has both an internal and an external head. We present a new test from extraposition facts that distinguishes between the raising and matching structures for relative clauses. Furthermore, this paper presents an account of the semantics of raising relative clauses which is intended to complete the picture of the semantics of relative clauses. In particular, we argue that raising relative clauses are not islands for Quantifier Raising (QR) and that in these clauses there is successive cyclic movement through a CP-adjoined position.},

The introduction offers a critical survey of early syntactic accounts and recent semantic advancements. One contribution presents the results of experimental research providing a new perspective on the last resort status of resumption. Two seminal papers on resumption, Doron (1982) and McCloskey (1990), have also been included. This volume, which deals with a phenomenon that has given rise to intriguing claims concerning the structure and interpretation of pronouns, will be of great interest to both semanticists and syntacticians, whichever framework they favor.},

Resumptive chains are thus akin to the well-known stranding analysis of quantifier float. A taxonomy of islands is developed that crucially ties barriers for movement to agreement possibilities. The stranding of a resumptive pronoun is shown to limit the role of agreement for the moving element, thereby allowing a chain to be formed across an island.},

On the basis of new facts in Hebrew and systematic differences between optional and obligatory pronouns, I argue that the tail of a relative clause movement chain is realized as the least specified form available. Since their interpretive properties are fully determined by external factors, resumptive pronouns must be part of the syntactic derivation, not items merged from the (traditional) lexicon.},

The possibility for extraction has often been presented as evidence against a syntactic theory of locality, and in favor of constraints defined in terms of information structure, or processing limitations and constraints on working memory. Another possibility, still hardly explored, is that locality is determined syntactically, combined with a more fine-grained structure for RCs and a theory of how extraction from this structure interacts with the theory of locality. I argue in favor of the latter approach. I assume the structural ambiguity of RCs and argue that while externally headed RCs do block extraction, extraction is possible, under certain conditions, from a raising RC, and is formally similar to extraction from an embedded interrogative.},

In variable binding terms, unary quantifiers bind one variable. Two applications of unary quantifiers, as in the interpretation ofNo student likes every teacher, determine abinary (= (type {\textless}2{\textgreater}) quantifier; they express properties oftwo place predicate denotations. In variable binding terms they bind two variables. We call a binary quantifierFregean (orreducible) if it can in principle be expressed by the iterated application of unary quantifiers.In this paper we present two mathematical properties which distinguish non-Fregean quantifiers from Fregean ones. Our results extend those of van Benthem (1989) and Keenan (1987a). We use them to show that English presents a large variety of non-Fregean quantifiers. Some are new here, others are familiar (though the proofs that they are non-Fregean are not).The main point of our empirical work is to inform us regarding the types of quantification natural language presents — in particular (van Benthem, 1989) that it goes beyond the usual (Fregean) analysis which treats it as mere iterated application of unary quantifiers.Secondarily, our results challenge linguistic approaches to “Logical Form” which constrain variable binding operators to “locally” bind just one occurrence of a variable, e.g., the Bijection Principle (BP) of Koopman and Sportiche (1983). The BP (correctly) blocks analyses likeFor which x, x's mother kissed x? forWho did his mother kiss? sinceFor which x would locally bind two occurrences ofx. But some of our irreducible binary quantifiers are naturally represented by operators which do locally bind two variables.This paper is organized as follows: Section 1 provides an explicit formulation of our questions of concern. Section 2 classifies the English constructions which we show to be non-Fregean. Section 3 presents the mathematical properties which test for non-Fregean quantification and applies these tests to the constructions in Section 2. Proofs of the mathematical properties are given in the Appendix.},

	abstract = {Osherson and Smith (1981, Cognition, 11, 237–262) discuss a number of problems which arise for a prototype-based account of the meanings of simple and complex concepts. Assuming that concept combination in such a theory is to be analyzed in terms of fuzzy logic, they show that some complex concepts inevitably get assigned the wrong meanings. In the present paper we argue that many of the problems O\&S discovered are due to difficulties that are intrinsic to fuzzy set theory, and that most of them disappear when fuzzy logic is replaced by supervaluation theory. However, even after this replacement one of O\&S's central problems remains: the theory still predicts that the degree to which an object is an instance of, say, “striped apple” must be less than or equal to both the degree to which it is an instance of “striped” and the degree to which it is an instance of “apple”, but this constraint conflicts with O\&S's experimental results. The second part of the paper explores ways of solving this and related problems. This leads us to suggest a number of distinctions and principles concerning how prototypicality and other mechanisms interact and which seem important for semantics generally. Prominent among these are (i) the distinction between on the one hand the logical and semantic properties of concepts and on the other the linguistic that between concepts for which the extension is determined by their prototype and concepts for which extension and prototypicality are independent.},

Recent experimental research has shown evidence of very rapid effects of referential context in resolving local indeterminacies on-line. However, there has been no consensus regarding the nature of these context effects. The current paper summarizes recent work covering a range of phenomena for which referential contrast has been shown to influence on-line processing, including prenominal and postnominal modification, focus operators, and intonational focus. The results of the body of work suggest that referential context effects are not limited to situations in which the linguistic form of the utterance directly specifies the point of contact with context. Rather, context effects of a pragmatic, Gricean nature appear to be possible, suggesting the relationship between linguistic form and context in rapid on-line processing can be of a very indirect nature.},

As resumptives, strong pronouns and epithet phrases cannot be related to a quantificational antecedent unless they occur inside islands. We account for this Obviation Requirement as follows: (a) (true) resumption is a last resort device, (b) strong pronouns and epithet phrases in apparent resumption contexts are generated as appositive modifiers of a DP, which is fronted to an Ā -position, and (c) appositive modifiers are interpreted as independent clauses.

The analysis is carried out within the Principles \& Parameters framework. The first two chapters address relative clauses. Based on a detailed examination of reconstruction, it is argued that German restrictive relatives should be given a Matching Analysis. Chapter three analyzes an alternative to long-distance relativization in German and Dutch where the relative pronoun is governed by the preposition von/van ‘of’ and a resumptive appears instead of a gap in the complement clause. The construction has the hallmarks of an indirect A’-dependency: The external head is interpreted inside the complement clause but cannot be transformationally related to that position. The paradox is resolved by postulating short A’-movement in the matrix clause, operator movement in the complement clause and an ellipsis operation that links the chains. Chapter four analyzes relative clauses in Zurich German. While local relativization is shown to be largely parallel to Standard German, long-distance relativization is reanalyzed in terms of Resumptive Prolepsis. This study is of interest to anyone interested in the syntax of relative clauses, reconstruction, resumption or in the syntax of Standard German, Zurich German and Dutch.},

Assuming compositionality, this means that the meaning of these clauses is not fully determined by their truth conditions. This finding has a clear explanation in inquisitive semantics: truth-conditionally equivalent clauses may be associated with different propositional alternatives, each of which counts as a separate counterfactual assumption. Second, we show that our results contradict the common idea that the interpretation of a counterfactual involves minimizing change with respect to the actual state of affairs. We propose to replace the idea of minimal change by a distinction between foreground and background for a given counterfactual assumption: the background is held fixed in the counterfactual situation, while the foreground can be varied without any minimality constraint.},

Yet in formal acceptability studies Scandinavian participants often show 'island effects': they reject island-violating movement similarly to native speakers of 'island-sensitive' languages. To investigate this apparent mismatch between informal and formal judgments, we conducted two acceptability judgment experiments testing the acceptability of topicalization from various island domains in Norwegian. We were interested in determining whether we could (i) find evidence for island insensitivity and (ii) pin down the source of qualitatively different island effects. We asked whether such effects are best explained as reflecting violations of a uniform syntactic constraint or extrasyntactic factors. Our results suggest that embedded questions and relative clauses are not uniform syntactic islands for topicalization, but complex NPs are. Unexpectedly, we also found evidence suggesting that conditional adjunct clauses may not be islands.*},

We show that this economy condition allows us to derive a number of generalizations, such as, in particular, the ‘Implicature Focus Generalization’: scalar implicatures can be embedded under a downward-entailing operator only if the (relevant) scalar term bears pitch accent. Our economy condition also derives specific predictions regarding the licensing of so-called Hurford disjunctions.},
