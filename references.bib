  abstract = {It is often assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that speakers generate special cues in whispered tone and intonation to make up for the absence of fundamental frequency. The present study examined this assumption with one production and three perception experiments. The production experiment compared duration, intensity, formants and spectral tilt of phonated and whispered Mandarin monosyllabic utterances with four lexical tones spoken as either statements or questions. For tones, no acoustic properties were found to occur only in whispered but not in phonated utterances. For intonation, some spectral tilt measurements differed between the two phonation types. The two tone perception experiments used phonated and whispered utterances as well as amplitude-modulated noise based on those utterances as stimuli. Results show that once turned into amplitude-modulated noise, phonated and whispered tones had similar identification patterns, indicating that the non-F0 tonal cues in whispers were already in phonated speech. The intonation perception experiment used original utterances as stimuli and showed a substantial drop in overall identification rate and an overwhelming bias towards statement. Thus the spectral tilt differences found in the acoustic analysis were not helpful for intonation perception. Possible reasons for the lack of effective enhancement in whispered speech were discussed.},

The participants in this experiment include tonal vs. non-tonal language speakers and musicians vs. non-musicians. The results show that the pitch classification function significantly shifted under different spectral conditions. Listeners generally hear higher pitches when the spectrum includes more high-frequency energy (i.e., tenser phonation).

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of articulatory information for Mandarin tone modeling and recognition in a deep neural network \textendash{} hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) framework. In conventional approaches, prosodic evidence (e.g., F0, duration and energy) is used to build tone classifiers, we here propose performance enhancement techniques in three areas: (i) adding articulatory features (AFs) and acoustic features, such as MFCCs (Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients), for tone modeling; (ii) adopting phone-dependent tone modeling; and (iii) using tone-based extended recognition network (ERN) to reduce the tone search space. The first approach is feature-related, it explicitly employs the AFs as a form of tonal features and is implemented through a multi-stage procedure. The second approach is model-related and directly extends to phone-dependent tone modeling so that each modeling unit (e.g., tonal phone) not only contains tone information, but also integrates the phone/articulatory information. Finally, the third technique is search-related with a phone-dependent tone-based expanding searching network. A series of comprehensive experiments is conducted using different input feature sets. It is demonstrated that (i) tone recognition accuracy is boosted by incorporating articulatory information, and (ii) ERN, attains the lowest tone error rate of 7.17\%, with a 56\% relative error reduction from the prosody-only baseline system error of 16.36\%.},

  abstract = {In tone languages, the identity of a word depends on its tone pattern as well as its phonetic structure. The primary cue to tone identity is the fundamental frequency (F0) contour. Two experiments explore how listeners perceive Mandarin monosyllables in which all or part of the F0 information has been neutralized. In Experiment 1, supposedly critical portions of the tonal pattern were neutralized with signal processing techniques, yet identification of the tonal pattern remained quite good. In Experiment 2, even more drastic removal of tonal information was tested, using stimuli whispered by Mandarin speakers, or signal processed to remove the pitch cues. Again, performance was surprisingly good, showing that listeners can use secondary cues when the primary cue is unavailable. Moreover, a comparison of tone perception of naturally whispered monosyllables and the signal processed ones suggests that Mandarin speakers promote the utility of secondary cues when they know that the primary cue will be unavailable. The flexible use of cues to tone in Mandarin is similar to the flexibility that has been found in the production and perception of cues to phonetic identity in Western languages.},

In a natural environment this overestimation could provide a selective advantage, because rising intensity can signal movement of the source towards an organism. The bias was stronger at higher levels, suggesting that rising loudness is even more critical when a sound source is either close or loud. These results suggest a privileged status of dynamic rising loudness for harmonic tones and an asymmetry in the neural coding of harmonic dynamic intensity change.},

  abstract = {Some acoustic correlates of Mandarin tones and their interaction have been tested. Production studies have demonstrated that lexical tones were most clearly demonstrated when produced in citation forms. The phonology specifies how lexical tones can be reduced by way of stress rules and different neutralization rules. Production data of Mandarin Chinese spontaneous speech were used to test these phonological specifications. Acoustic analysis of the production data made it possible to determine whether a one-to-one correlation could be found between the phonological prediction and the actual phonetic output. A low correlation (36.13\%) was found. Complementary perception studies show that when forced to identify lexical tones produced in citations, listeners performed almost perfectly. When forced to identify lexical tones edited from spontaneous speech, listeners' performance was relatively poor (41\% of correct identification). The results show that the actual production and perception of spontaneous speech is very likely a cognitive decision involving interacting linguistic/extra-linguistic factors. A native speaker's knowledge of the language enables him to produce and perceive only partially specified phonetic information in verbal communication. There appears to be a trade-off effect between the lower level phonetics, phonology and the other "higher" linguistic levels. Phonology and phonetics alone are insufficient in predicting the actual output of sentences regarding tones. An initial study of the interaction between lexical tones and intonation demonstrates modulation of tones and intonation. Production data of Mandarin simple declarative sentences from spontaneous speech were utilized to test two intonation theories, i.e., the breath-group theory (Lieberman, 1967) and the declination theory (Maeda, 1976; Breckenridge and Liberman, 1977; Pierrehumbert (nee Breckenridge), 1979; Sorensen and Cooper, 1980). The results of the experiment showed a low portion (20\%) of Mandarin sentences that could be characterized by the declination theory, whereas 74\% of the data could be characterized by the breath-group theory. However, 26\% of the data could not be characterized by either theory. We suspect, as Umeda and Coker (1980) have pointed out, that the declination effect is more of a discourse effect rather than a sentential phenomenon, and that a potential universal intonation theory should allow more room for flexibility.},

  abstract = {The current study aims to investigate how Taiwan Mandarin lexical tone is realized in whisper through duration and intensity and how they affect listeners' whispered tone perception when no other possible signals play a potential role. Previous studies have examined the  durations and intensity contours of each tone in whispered Mandarin speech, and argued that duration and intensity contour could serve as tonal cues in the absence of F0 information. However, most of the studies focused on Beijing Mandarin, where Tone 3 is associated with a long duration and dipping contour (termed ``full Tone 3''). In addition, individual differences and other acoustic properties could potentially undermine the accountabilities of duration and intensity as to whispered tone perception. To resolve the issues, this study constitutes one production experiment and two perception experiments and targets on Taiwan Mandarin which has a unique phonetic realization of Tone 3. In the production experiment, Taiwan Mandarin native speakers were instructed to articulate and to whisper monosyllables of all four tones with two Tone 3 variants: ``full Tone 3'' with a long duration and dipping contour, and ``half Tone 3'' with a short duration and falling contour. In the two perception experiments, native listeners were asked to distinguish whispered tones which contrasted in only duration and intensity contour. The only difference between the two perception experiments lies in whether the correct answer was provided in the response choices. The results from the production experiment, where participants were asked to articulate and whisper monosyllables, showed that full Tone 3 had the longest duration and a clear dipping intensity contour, while Tone 4 had the shortest duration and falling contour that spanned over the largest intensity range. Moreover, as revealed by the results of the perception experiment, where participants were asked to discriminate whispered tones that were only different in duration and intensity, for the full Tone 3 group, Tone 4 had the highest accuracy rate while Tone 1 had the lowest; for the half Tone 3 group, Tone 4 still had the highest accuracy rate while half Tone 3 had the lowest. Given that different cues within a response pair were available to the listeners, different cues might be employed to distinguish different whispered tones. The participants' sensitivity to the response pairs was largely reflected by the numbers of cues available to the listeners, though with some exceptions. In the absence of the correct answer, listeners tended to identify the tones that matched most closely to the auditorily presented stimuli in terms of duration and intensity. Therefore, listeners identified whispered tones with duration and intensity as cues.},
